Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit d76c68109f37cb85b243a1cf0f40313afd2bae68

    crypto: pcrypt - fix freeing pcrypt instances
    
    pcrypt is using the old way of freeing instances, where the ->free()
    method specified in the 'struct crypto_template' is passed a pointer to
    the 'struct crypto_instance'.  But the crypto_instance is being
    kfree()'d directly, which is incorrect because the memory was actually
    allocated as an aead_instance, which contains the crypto_instance at a
    nonzero offset.  Thus, the wrong pointer was being kfree()'d.
    
    Fix it by switching to the new way to free aead_instance's where the
    ->free() method is specified in the aead_instance itself.
