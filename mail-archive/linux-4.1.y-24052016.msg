    IB/security: Restrict use of the write() interface
    
    The drivers/infiniband stack uses write() as a replacement for
    bi-directional ioctl().  This is not safe. There are ways to
    trigger write calls that result in the return structure that
    is normally written to user space being shunted off to user
    specified kernel memory instead.
    
    For the immediate repair, detect and deny suspicious accesses to
    the write API.
    
    For long term, update the user space libraries and the kernel API
    to something that doesn't present the same security vulnerabilities
    (likely a structured ioctl() interface).
    
    The impacted uAPI interfaces are generally only available if
    hardware from drivers/infiniband is installed in the system.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 99d825822eade8d827a1817357cbf3f889a552d6
Author: Al Viro <viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk>

    get_rock_ridge_filename(): handle malformed NM entries
    
    Payloads of NM entries are not supposed to contain NUL.  When we run
    into such, only the part prior to the first NUL goes into the
    concatenation (i.e. the directory entry name being encoded by a bunch
    of NM entries).  We do stop when the amount collected so far + the
    claimed amount in the current NM entry exceed 254.  So far, so good,
    but what we return as the total length is the sum of *claimed*
    sizes, not the actual amount collected.  And that can grow pretty
    large - not unlimited, since you'd need to put CE entries in
    between to be able to get more than the maximum that could be
    contained in one isofs directory entry / continuation chunk and
    we are stop once we'd encountered 32 CEs, but you can get about 8Kb
    easily.  And that's what will be passed to readdir callback as the
    name length.  8Kb __copy_to_user() from a buffer allocated by
    __get_free_page()
