Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit bceaa90240b6019ed73b49965eac7d167610be69
Author: Hannes Frederic Sowa <hannes@stressinduktion.org>
Date:   Mon Nov 18 04:20:45 2013 +0100

    inet: prevent leakage of uninitialized memory to user in recv syscalls
    
    Only update *addr_len when we actually fill in sockaddr, otherwise we
    can return uninitialized memory from the stack to the caller in the
    recvfrom, recvmmsg and recvmsg syscalls. Drop the the (addr_len == NULL)
    checks because we only get called with a valid addr_len pointer either
    from sock_common_recvmsg or inet_recvmsg.
    
    If a blocking read waits on a socket which is concurrently shut down we
    now return zero and set msg_msgnamelen to 0.
