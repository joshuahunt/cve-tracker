    ALSA: seq: Fix racy pool initializations
    
    ALSA sequencer core initializes the event pool on demand by invoking
    snd_seq_pool_init() when the first write happens and the pool is
    empty.  Meanwhile user can reset the pool size manually via ioctl
    concurrently, and this may lead to UAF or out-of-bound accesses since
    the function tries to vmalloc / vfree the buffer.
    
    A simple fix is to just wrap the snd_seq_pool_init() call with the
    recently introduced client->ioctl_mutex; as the calls for
    snd_seq_pool_init() from other side are always protected with this
    mutex, we can avoid the race.
