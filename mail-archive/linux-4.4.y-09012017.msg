Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit ef85b67385436ddc1998f45f1d6a210f935b3388
Author: Jim Mattson <jmattson@google.com>
Date:   Mon Dec 12 11:01:37 2016 -0800

    kvm: nVMX: Allow L1 to intercept software exceptions (#BP and #OF)
    
    When L2 exits to L0 due to "exception or NMI", software exceptions
    (#BP and #OF) for which L1 has requested an intercept should be
    handled by L1 rather than L0. Previously, only hardware exceptions
    were forwarded to L1.
