Description of fix for this vulnerability:

    s390/mm: four page table levels vs. fork
    
    The fork of a process with four page table levels is broken since
    git commit 6252d702c5311ce9 "[S390] dynamic page tables."
    
    All new mm contexts are created with three page table levels and
    an asce limit of 4TB. If the parent has four levels dup_mmap will
    add vmas to the new context which are outside of the asce limit.
    The subsequent call to copy_page_range will walk the three level
    page table structure of the new process with non-zero pgd and pud
    indexes. This leads to memory clobbers as the pgd_index *and* the
    pud_index is added to the mm->pgd pointer without a pgd_deref
    in between.
    
    The init_new_context() function is selecting the number of page
    table levels for a new context. The function is used by mm_init()
    which in turn is called by dup_mm() and mm_alloc(). These two are
    used by fork() and exec(). The init_new_context() function can
    distinguish the two cases by looking at mm->context.asce_limit,
    for fork() the mm struct has been copied and the number of page
    table levels may not change. For exec() the mm_alloc() function
    set the new mm structure to zero, in this case a three-level page
    table is created as the temporary stack space is located at
    STACK_TOP_MAX = 4TB.
    
    This fixes CVE-2016-2143.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 8b8addf891de8a00e4d39fc32f93f7c5eb8feceb
Author: Hector Marco-Gisbert <hecmargi@upv.es>
Date:   Thu Mar 10 20:51:00 2016 +0100

    x86/mm/32: Enable full randomization on i386 and X86_32
    
    Currently on i386 and on X86_64 when emulating X86_32 in legacy mode, only
    the stack and the executable are randomized but not other mmapped files
    (libraries, vDSO, etc.). This patch enables randomization for the
    libraries, vDSO and mmap requests on i386 and in X86_32 in legacy mode.
    
    By default on i386 there are 8 bits for the randomization of the libraries,
    vDSO and mmaps which only uses 1MB of VA.
    
    This patch preserves the original randomness, using 1MB of VA out of 3GB or
    4GB. We think that 1MB out of 3GB is not a big cost for having the ASLR.
    
    The first obvious security benefit is that all objects are randomized (not
    only the stack and the executable) in legacy mode which highly increases
    the ASLR effectiveness, otherwise the attackers may use these
    non-randomized areas. But also sensitive setuid/setgid applications are
    more secure because currently, attackers can disable the randomization of
    these applications by setting the ulimit stack to "unlimited". This is a
    very old and widely known trick to disable the ASLR in i386 which has been
    allowed for too long.
    
    Another trick used to disable the ASLR was to set the ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE
    personality flag, but fortunately this doesn't work on setuid/setgid
    applications because there is security checks which clear Security-relevant
    flags.
    
    This patch always randomizes the mmap_legacy_base address, removing the
    possibility to disable the ASLR by setting the stack to "unlimited".

    usbnet: cleanup after bind() in probe()
    
    In case bind() works, but a later error forces bailing
    in probe() in error cases work and a timer may be scheduled.
    They must be killed. This fixes an error case related to
    the double free reported in
    http://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg367669.html
    and needs to go on top of Linus' fix to cdc-ncm.

    cdc_ncm: do not call usbnet_link_change from cdc_ncm_bind
    
    usbnet_link_change will call schedule_work and should be
    avoided if bind is failing. Otherwise we will end up with
    scheduled work referring to a netdev which has gone away.
    
    Instead of making the call conditional, we can just defer
    it to usbnet_probe, using the driver_info flag made for
    this purpose.
