    netfilter: ipv6: nf_defrag: drop mangled skb on ream error
    
    Dmitry Vyukov reported GPF in network stack that Andrey traced down to
    negative nh offset in nf_ct_frag6_queue().
    
    Problem is that all network headers before fragment header are pulled.
    Normal ipv6 reassembly will drop the skb when errors occur further down
    the line.
    
    netfilter doesn't do this, and instead passed the original fragment
    along.  That was also fine back when netfilter ipv6 defrag worked with
    cloned fragments, as the original, pristine fragment was passed on.
    
    So we either have to undo the pull op, or discard such fragments.
    Since they're malformed after all (e.g. overlapping fragment) it seems
    preferrable to just drop them.
    
    Same for temporary errors -- it doesn't make sense to accept (and
    perhaps forward!) only some fragments of same datagram.
