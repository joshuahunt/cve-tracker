Description of fix for this vulnerability:

    mm, thp: Do not make page table dirty unconditionally in touch_p[mu]d()
    
    Currently, we unconditionally make page table dirty in touch_pmd().
    It may result in false-positive can_follow_write_pmd().
    
    We may avoid the situation, if we would only make the page table entry
    dirty if caller asks for write access -- FOLL_WRITE.
    
    The patch also changes touch_pud() in the same way.

    [media] cx231xx-cards: fix NULL-deref on missing association descriptor
    
    Make sure to check that we actually have an Interface Association
    Descriptor before dereferencing it during probe to avoid dereferencing a
    NULL-pointer.

    ipsec: Fix aborted xfrm policy dump crash
    
    An independent security researcher, Mohamed Ghannam, has reported
    this vulnerability to Beyond Security's SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure
    program.
    
    The xfrm_dump_policy_done function expects xfrm_dump_policy to
    have been called at least once or it will crash.  This can be
    triggered if a dump fails because the target socket's receive
    buffer is full.
    
    This patch fixes it by using the cb->start mechanism to ensure that
    the initialisation is always done regardless of the buffer situation.
