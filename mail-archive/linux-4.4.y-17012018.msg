    unix: properly account for FDs passed over unix sockets
    
    It is possible for a process to allocate and accumulate far more FDs than
    the process' limit by sending them over a unix socket then closing them
    to keep the process' fd count low.
    
    This change addresses this problem by keeping track of the number of FDs
    in flight per user and preventing non-privileged processes from having
    more FDs in flight than their configured FD limit.

    mm: Add a user_ns owner to mm_struct and fix ptrace permission checks
    
    During exec dumpable is cleared if the file that is being executed is
    not readable by the user executing the file.  A bug in
    ptrace_may_access allows reading the file if the executable happens to
    enter into a subordinate user namespace (aka clone(CLONE_NEWUSER),
    unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER), or setns(fd, CLONE_NEWUSER).
    
    This problem is fixed with only necessary userspace breakage by adding
    a user namespace owner to mm_struct, captured at the time of exec, so
    it is clear in which user namespace CAP_SYS_PTRACE must be present in
    to be able to safely give read permission to the executable.
    
    The function ptrace_may_access is modified to verify that the ptracer
    has CAP_SYS_ADMIN in task->mm->user_ns instead of task->cred->user_ns.
    This ensures that if the task changes it's cred into a subordinate
    user namespace it does not become ptraceable.
    
    The function ptrace_attach is modified to only set PT_PTRACE_CAP when
    CAP_SYS_PTRACE is held over task->mm->user_ns.  The intent of
    PT_PTRACE_CAP is to be a flag to note that whatever permission changes
    the task might go through the tracer has sufficient permissions for
    it not to be an issue.  task->cred->user_ns is always the same
    as or descendent of mm->user_ns.  Which guarantees that having
    CAP_SYS_PTRACE over mm->user_ns is the worst case for the tasks
    credentials.
    
    To prevent regressions mm->dumpable and mm->user_ns are not considered
    when a task has no mm.  As simply failing ptrace_may_attach causes
    regressions in privileged applications attempting to read things
    such as /proc/<pid>/stat

    ext4: fix races of writeback with punch hole and zero range
    
    When doing delayed allocation, update of on-disk inode size is postponed
    until IO submission time. However hole punch or zero range fallocate
    calls can end up discarding the tail page cache page and thus on-disk
    inode size would never be properly updated.
    
    Make sure the on-disk inode size is updated before truncating page
    cache.

    ext4: move unlocked dio protection from ext4_alloc_file_blocks()
    
    Currently ext4_alloc_file_blocks() was handling protection against
    unlocked DIO. However we now need to sometimes call it under i_mmap_sem
    and sometimes not and DIO protection ranks above it (although strictly
    speaking this cannot currently create any deadlocks). Also
    ext4_zero_range() was actually getting & releasing unlocked DIO
    protection twice in some cases. Luckily it didn't introduce any real bug
    but it was a land mine waiting to be stepped on.  So move DIO protection
    out from ext4_alloc_file_blocks() into the two callsites.

    ext4: fix races between buffered IO and collapse / insert range
    
    Current code implementing FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE and
    FALLOC_FL_INSERT_RANGE is prone to races with buffered writes and page
    faults. If buffered write or write via mmap manages to squeeze between
    filemap_write_and_wait_range() and truncate_pagecache() in the fallocate
    implementations, the written data is simply discarded by
    truncate_pagecache() although it should have been shifted.
    
    Fix the problem by moving filemap_write_and_wait_range() call inside
    i_mutex and i_mmap_sem. That way we are protected against races with
    both buffered writes and page faults.

    ext4: fix races between page faults and hole punching
    
    Currently, page faults and hole punching are completely unsynchronized.
    This can result in page fault faulting in a page into a range that we
    are punching after truncate_pagecache_range() has been called and thus
    we can end up with a page mapped to disk blocks that will be shortly
    freed. Filesystem corruption will shortly follow. Note that the same
    race is avoided for truncate by checking page fault offset against
    i_size but there isn't similar mechanism available for punching holes.
    
    Fix the problem by creating new rw semaphore i_mmap_sem in inode and
    grab it for writing over truncate, hole punching, and other functions
    removing blocks from extent tree and for read over page faults. We
    cannot easily use i_data_sem for this since that ranks below transaction
    start and we need something ranking above it so that it can be held over
    the whole truncate / hole punching operation. Also remove various
    workarounds we had in the code to reduce race window when page fault
    could have created pages with stale mapping information.

    /proc/iomem: only expose physical resource addresses to privileged users
    
    In commit c4004b02f8e5b ("x86: remove the kernel code/data/bss resources
    from /proc/iomem") I was hoping to remove the phyiscal kernel address
    data from /proc/iomem entirely, but that had to be reverted because some
    system programs actually use it.
    
    This limits all the detailed resource information to properly
    credentialed users instead.

    tty: Prevent ldisc drivers from re-using stale tty fields
    
    Line discipline drivers may mistakenly misuse ldisc-related fields
    when initializing. For example, a failure to initialize tty->receive_room
    in the N_GIGASET_M101 line discipline was recently found and fixed [1].
    Now, the N_X25 line discipline has been discovered accessing the previous
    line discipline's already-freed private data [2].
    
    Harden the ldisc interface against misuse by initializing revelant
    tty fields before instancing the new line discipline.

    crypto: af_alg - Disallow bind/setkey/... after accept(2)
    
    Each af_alg parent socket obtained by socket(2) corresponds to a
    tfm object once bind(2) has succeeded.  An accept(2) call on that
    parent socket creates a context which then uses the tfm object.
    
    Therefore as long as any child sockets created by accept(2) exist
    the parent socket must not be modified or freed.
    
    This patch guarantees this by using locks and a reference count
    on the parent socket.  Any attempt to modify the parent socket will
    fail with EBUSY.

    fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c: fix bugs in hugetlb_vmtruncate_list()
    
    Hillf Danton noticed bugs in the hugetlb_vmtruncate_list routine.  The
    argument end is of type pgoff_t.  It was being converted to a vaddr
    offset and passed to unmap_hugepage_range.  However, end was also being
    used as an argument to the vma_interval_tree_foreach controlling loop.
    In addition, the conversion of end to vaddr offset was incorrect.
    
    hugetlb_vmtruncate_list is called as part of a file truncate or
    fallocate hole punch operation.
    
    When truncating a hugetlbfs file, this bug could prevent some pages from
    being unmapped.  This is possible if there are multiple vmas mapping the
    file, and there is a sufficiently sized hole between the mappings.  The
    size of the hole between two vmas (A,B) must be such that the starting
    virtual address of B is greater than (ending virtual address of A <<
    PAGE_SHIFT).  In this case, the pages in B would not be unmapped.  If
    pages are not properly unmapped during truncate, the following BUG is
    hit:
    
    	kernel BUG at fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c:428!
    
    In the fallocate hole punch case, this bug could prevent pages from
    being unmapped as in the truncate case.  However, for hole punch the
    result is that unmapped pages will not be removed during the operation.
    For hole punch, it is also possible that more pages than desired will be
    unmapped.  This unnecessary unmapping will cause page faults to
    reestablish the mappings on subsequent page access.

    tty: Fix unsafe ldisc reference via ioctl(TIOCGETD)
    
    ioctl(TIOCGETD) retrieves the line discipline id directly from the
    ldisc because the line discipline id (c_line) in termios is untrustworthy;
    userspace may have set termios via ioctl(TCSETS*) without actually
    changing the line discipline via ioctl(TIOCSETD).
    
    However, directly accessing the current ldisc via tty->ldisc is
    unsafe; the ldisc ptr dereferenced may be stale if the line discipline
    is changing via ioctl(TIOCSETD) or hangup.
    
    Wait for the line discipline reference (just like read() or write())
    to retrieve the "current" line discipline id.

    KEYS: Fix keyring ref leak in join_session_keyring()
    
    This fixes CVE-2016-0728.
    
    If a thread is asked to join as a session keyring the keyring that's already
    set as its session, we leak a keyring reference.
    
    This can be tested with the following program:
    
    	#include <stddef.h>
    	#include <stdio.h>
    	#include <sys/types.h>
    	#include <keyutils.h>
    
    	int main(int argc, const char *argv[])
    	{
    		int i = 0;
    		key_serial_t serial;
    
    		serial = keyctl(KEYCTL_JOIN_SESSION_KEYRING,
    				"leaked-keyring");
    		if (serial < 0) {
    			perror("keyctl");
    			return -1;
    		}
    
    		if (keyctl(KEYCTL_SETPERM, serial,
    			   KEY_POS_ALL | KEY_USR_ALL) < 0) {
    			perror("keyctl");
    			return -1;
    		}
    
    		for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    			serial = keyctl(KEYCTL_JOIN_SESSION_KEYRING,
    					"leaked-keyring");
    			if (serial < 0) {
    				perror("keyctl");
    				return -1;
    			}
    		}
    
    		return 0;
    	}
    
    If, after the program has run, there something like the following line in
    /proc/keys:

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 23c8a812dc3c621009e4f0e5342aa4e2ede1ceaa
Author: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>
Date:   Tue Feb 23 11:03:12 2016 +0000

    KEYS: Fix ASN.1 indefinite length object parsing
    
    This fixes CVE-2016-0758.
    
    In the ASN.1 decoder, when the length field of an ASN.1 value is extracted,
    it isn't validated against the remaining amount of data before being added
    to the cursor.  With a sufficiently large size indicated, the check:
    
    	datalen - dp < 2
    
    may then fail due to integer overflow.
    
    Fix this by checking the length indicated against the amount of remaining
    data in both places a definite length is determined.
    
    Whilst we're at it, make the following changes:
    
     (1) Check the maximum size of extended length does not exceed the capacity
         of the variable it's being stored in (len) rather than the type that
         variable is assumed to be (size_t).
    
     (2) Compare the EOC tag to the symbolic constant ASN1_EOC rather than the
         integer 0.
    
     (3) To reduce confusion, move the initialisation of len outside of:
    
    	for (len = 0; n > 0; n--) {
    
         since it doesn't have anything to do with the loop counter n.

commit 22f6b4d34fcf039c63a94e7670e0da24f8575a5a

    aio: mark AIO pseudo-fs noexec
    
    This ensures that do_mmap() won't implicitly make AIO memory mappings
    executable if the READ_IMPLIES_EXEC personality flag is set.  Such
    behavior is problematic because the security_mmap_file LSM hook doesn't
    catch this case, potentially permitting an attacker to bypass a W^X
    policy enforced by SELinux.
    
    I have tested the patch on my machine.
    
    To test the behavior, compile and run this:
    
        #define _GNU_SOURCE
        #include <unistd.h>
        #include <sys/personality.h>
        #include <linux/aio_abi.h>
        #include <err.h>
        #include <stdlib.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <sys/syscall.h>
    
        int main(void) {
            personality(READ_IMPLIES_EXEC);
            aio_context_t ctx = 0;
            if (syscall(__NR_io_setup, 1, &ctx))
                err(1, "io_setup");
    
            char cmd[1000];
            sprintf(cmd, "cat /proc/%d/maps | grep -F '/[aio]'",
                (int)getpid());
            system(cmd);
            return 0;
        }
    
    In the output, "rw-s" is good, "rwxs" is bad.

    sg_write()/bsg_write() is not fit to be called under KERNEL_DS
    
    Both damn things interpret userland pointers embedded into the payload;
    worse, they are actually traversing those.  Leaving aside the bad
    API design, this is very much _not_ safe to call with KERNEL_DS.
    Bail out early if that happens.

    crypto: mcryptd - Check mcryptd algorithm compatibility
    
    Algorithms not compatible with mcryptd could be spawned by mcryptd
    with a direct crypto_alloc_tfm invocation using a "mcryptd(alg)" name
    construct.  This causes mcryptd to crash the kernel if an arbitrary
    "alg" is incompatible and not intended to be used with mcryptd.  It is
    an issue if AF_ALG tries to spawn mcryptd(alg) to expose it externally.
    But such algorithms must be used internally and not be exposed.
    
    We added a check to enforce that only internal algorithms are allowed
    with mcryptd at the time mcryptd is spawning an algorithm.

    l2tp: fix racy SOCK_ZAPPED flag check in l2tp_ip{,6}_bind()
    
    Lock socket before checking the SOCK_ZAPPED flag in l2tp_ip6_bind().
    Without lock, a concurrent call could modify the socket flags between
    the sock_flag(sk, SOCK_ZAPPED) test and the lock_sock() call. This way,
    a socket could be inserted twice in l2tp_ip6_bind_table. Releasing it
    would then leave a stale pointer there, generating use-after-free
    errors when walking through the list or modifying adjacent entries.

commit 3a4b77cd47bb837b8557595ec7425f281f2ca1fe
Author: Eryu Guan <guaneryu@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Dec 1 15:08:37 2016 -0500

    ext4: validate s_first_meta_bg at mount time
    
    Ralf Spenneberg reported that he hit a kernel crash when mounting a
    modified ext4 image. And it turns out that kernel crashed when
    calculating fs overhead (ext4_calculate_overhead()), this is because
    the image has very large s_first_meta_bg (debug code shows it's
    842150400), and ext4 overruns the memory in count_overhead() when
    setting bitmap buffer, which is PAGE_SIZE.
    
    ext4_calculate_overhead():
      buf = get_zeroed_page(GFP_NOFS);  <=== PAGE_SIZE buffer
      blks = count_overhead(sb, i, buf);
    
    count_overhead():
      for (j = ext4_bg_num_gdb(sb, grp); j > 0; j--) { <=== j = 842150400
              ext4_set_bit(EXT4_B2C(sbi, s++), buf);   <=== buffer overrun
              count++;
      }
    
    This can be reproduced easily for me by this script:
    
      #!/bin/bash
      rm -f fs.img
      mkdir -p /mnt/ext4
      fallocate -l 16M fs.img
      mke2fs -t ext4 -O bigalloc,meta_bg,^resize_inode -F fs.img
      debugfs -w -R "ssv first_meta_bg 842150400" fs.img
      mount -o loop fs.img /mnt/ext4
    
    Fix it by validating s_first_meta_bg first at mount time, and

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 197c949e7798fbf28cfadc69d9ca0c2abbf93191
Author: Eric Dumazet <edumazet@google.com>
Date:   Wed Dec 30 08:51:12 2015 -0500

    udp: properly support MSG_PEEK with truncated buffers
    
    Backport of this upstream commit into stable kernels :
    89c22d8c3b27 ("net: Fix skb csum races when peeking")
    exposed a bug in udp stack vs MSG_PEEK support, when user provides
    a buffer smaller than skb payload.
    
    In this case,
    skb_copy_and_csum_datagram_iovec(skb, sizeof(struct udphdr),
                                     msg->msg_iov);
    returns -EFAULT.
    
    This bug does not happen in upstream kernels since Al Viro did a great
    job to replace this into :
    skb_copy_and_csum_datagram_msg(skb, sizeof(struct udphdr), msg);
    This variant is safe vs short buffers.
    
    For the time being, instead reverting Herbert Xu patch and add back
    skb->ip_summed invalid changes, simply store the result of
    udp_lib_checksum_complete() so that we avoid computing the checksum a
    second time, and avoid the problematic
    skb_copy_and_csum_datagram_iovec() call.
    
    This patch can be applied on recent kernels as it avoids a double
    checksumming, then backported to stable kernels as a bug fix.

commit 163ae1c6ad6299b19e22b4a35d5ab24a89791a98
Author: Eric Biggers <ebiggers@google.com>
Date:   Thu Sep 8 10:57:08 2016 -0700

    fscrypto: add authorization check for setting encryption policy
    
    On an ext4 or f2fs filesystem with file encryption supported, a user
    could set an encryption policy on any empty directory(*) to which they
    had readonly access.  This is obviously problematic, since such a
    directory might be owned by another user and the new encryption policy
    would prevent that other user from creating files in their own directory
    (for example).
    
    Fix this by requiring inode_owner_or_capable() permission to set an
    encryption policy.  This means that either the caller must own the file,
    or the caller must have the capability CAP_FOWNER.
    
    (*) Or also on any regular file, for f2fs v4.6 and later and ext4
        v4.8-rc1 and later; a separate bug fix is coming for that.

Date:   Wed Jun 22 19:43:35 2016 +0100

    nfsd: check permissions when setting ACLs
    
    Use set_posix_acl, which includes proper permission checks, instead of
    calling ->set_acl directly.  Without this anyone may be able to grant
    themselves permissions to a file by setting the ACL.
    
    Lock the inode to make the new checks atomic with respect to set_acl.
    (Also, nfsd was the only caller of set_acl not locking the inode, so I
    suspect this may fix other races.)
    
    This also simplifies the code, and ensures our ACLs are checked by
    posix_acl_valid.
    
    The permission checks and the inode locking were lost with commit
    4ac7249e, which changed nfsd to use the set_acl inode operation directly
    instead of going through xattr handlers.

    proc: prevent stacking filesystems on top
    
    This prevents stacking filesystems (ecryptfs and overlayfs) from using
    procfs as lower filesystem.  There is too much magic going on inside
    procfs, and there is no good reason to stack stuff on top of procfs.
    
    (For example, procfs does access checks in VFS open handlers, and

    drop privileges or so.)

    x86/mm: Add barriers and document switch_mm()-vs-flush synchronization
    
    When switch_mm() activates a new PGD, it also sets a bit that
    tells other CPUs that the PGD is in use so that TLB flush IPIs
    will be sent.  In order for that to work correctly, the bit
    needs to be visible prior to loading the PGD and therefore
    starting to fill the local TLB.

    a couple that were missing.

    atl2: Disable unimplemented scatter/gather feature
    
    atl2 includes NETIF_F_SG in hw_features even though it has no support
    for non-linear skbs.  This bug was originally harmless since the
    driver does not claim to implement checksum offload and that used to
    be a requirement for SG.
    
    Now that SG and checksum offload are independent features, if you
    explicitly enable SG *and* use one of the rare protocols that can use
    SG without checkusm offload, this potentially leaks sensitive
    information (before you notice that it just isn't working).  Therefore
    this obscure bug has been designated CVE-2016-2117.

    s390/mm: four page table levels vs. fork
    
    The fork of a process with four page table levels is broken since
    git commit 6252d702c5311ce9 "[S390] dynamic page tables."
    
    All new mm contexts are created with three page table levels and
    an asce limit of 4TB. If the parent has four levels dup_mmap will
    add vmas to the new context which are outside of the asce limit.
    The subsequent call to copy_page_range will walk the three level
    page table structure of the new process with non-zero pgd and pud
    indexes. This leads to memory clobbers as the pgd_index *and* the
    pud_index is added to the mm->pgd pointer without a pgd_deref
    in between.
    
    The init_new_context() function is selecting the number of page
    table levels for a new context. The function is used by mm_init()
    which in turn is called by dup_mm() and mm_alloc(). These two are
    used by fork() and exec(). The init_new_context() function can
    distinguish the two cases by looking at mm->context.asce_limit,
    for fork() the mm struct has been copied and the number of page
    table levels may not change. For exec() the mm_alloc() function
    set the new mm structure to zero, in this case a three-level page
    table is created as the temporary stack space is located at
    STACK_TOP_MAX = 4TB.
    
    This fixes CVE-2016-2143.

    bpf: fix branch offset adjustment on backjumps after patching ctx expansion
    
    When ctx access is used, the kernel often needs to expand/rewrite
    instructions, so after that patching, branch offsets have to be
    adjusted for both forward and backward jumps in the new eBPF program,
    but for backward jumps it fails to account the delta. Meaning, for
    example, if the expansion happens exactly on the insn that sits at
    the jump target, it doesn't fix up the back jump offset.
    
    Analysis on what the check in adjust_branches() is currently doing:
    
      /* adjust offset of jmps if necessary */
      if (i < pos && i + insn->off + 1 > pos)
        insn->off += delta;
      else if (i > pos && i + insn->off + 1 < pos)
        insn->off -= delta;
    
    First condition (forward jumps):
    
      Before:                         After:
    
      insns[0]                        insns[0]
      insns[1] <--- i/insn            insns[1] <--- i/insn
      insns[2] <--- pos               insns[P] <--- pos
      insns[3]                        insns[P]  `------| delta
      insns[4] <--- target_X          insns[P]   `-----|
      insns[5]                        insns[3]
                                      insns[4] <--- target_X
                                      insns[5]
    
    First case is if we cross pos-boundary and the jump instruction was
    before pos. This is handeled correctly. I.e. if i == pos, then this
    would mean our jump that we currently check was the patchlet itself
    that we just injected. Since such patchlets are self-contained and
    have no awareness of any insns before or after the patched one, the
    delta is correctly not adjusted. Also, for the second condition in
    case of i + insn->off + 1 == pos, means we jump to that newly patched
    instruction, so no offset adjustment are needed. That part is correct.
    
    Second condition (backward jumps):
    
      Before:                         After:
    
      insns[0]                        insns[0]
      insns[1] <--- target_X          insns[1] <--- target_X
      insns[2] <--- pos <-- target_Y  insns[P] <--- pos <-- target_Y
      insns[3]                        insns[P]  `------| delta
      insns[4] <--- i/insn            insns[P]   `-----|
      insns[5]                        insns[3]
                                      insns[4] <--- i/insn
                                      insns[5]
    
    Second interesting case is where we cross pos-boundary and the jump
    instruction was after pos. Backward jump with i == pos would be
    impossible and pose a bug somewhere in the patchlet, so the first
    condition checking i > pos is okay only by itself. However, i +
    insn->off + 1 < pos does not always work as intended to trigger the
    adjustment. It works when jump targets would be far off where the
    delta wouldn't matter. But, for example, where the fixed insn->off
    before pointed to pos (target_Y), it now points to pos + delta, so
    that additional room needs to be taken into account for the check.
    This means that i) both tests here need to be adjusted into pos + delta,
    and ii) for the second condition, the test needs to be <= as pos
    itself can be a target in the backjump, too.

    ALSA: timer: Fix race among timer ioctls
    
    ALSA timer ioctls have an open race and this may lead to a
    use-after-free of timer instance object.  A simplistic fix is to make
    each ioctl exclusive.  We have already tread_sem for controlling the
    tread, and extend this as a global mutex to be applied to each ioctl.
    
    The downside is, of course, the worse concurrency.  But these ioctls
    aren't to be parallel accessible, in anyway, so it should be fine to
    serialize there.

    ALSA: timer: Harden slave timer list handling
    
    A slave timer instance might be still accessible in a racy way while
    operating the master instance as it lacks of locking.  Since the
    master operation is mostly protected with timer->lock, we should cope
    with it while changing the slave instance, too.  Also, some linked
    lists (active_list and ack_list) of slave instances aren't unlinked
    immediately at stopping or closing, and this may lead to unexpected
    accesses.
    
    This patch tries to address these issues.  It adds spin lock of
    timer->lock (either from master or slave, which is equivalent) in a
    few places.  For avoiding a deadlock, we ensure that the global
    slave_active_lock is always locked at first before each timer lock.
    
    Also, ack and active_list of slave instances are properly unlinked at
    snd_timer_stop() and snd_timer_close().
    
    Last but not least, remove the superfluous call of _snd_timer_stop()
    at removing slave links.  This is a noop, and calling it may confuse
    readers wrt locking.  Further cleanup will follow in a later patch.
    
    Actually we've got reports of use-after-free by syzkaller fuzzer, and
    this hopefully fixes these issues.

    ALSA: hrtimer: Fix stall by hrtimer_cancel()
    
    hrtimer_cancel() waits for the completion from the callback, thus it
    must not be called inside the callback itself.  This was already a
    problem in the past with ALSA hrtimer driver, and the early commit
    [fcfdebe70759: ALSA: hrtimer - Fix lock-up] tried to address it.
    
    However, the previous fix is still insufficient: it may still cause a
    lockup when the ALSA timer instance reprograms itself in its callback.
    Then it invokes the start function even in snd_timer_interrupt() that
    is called in hrtimer callback itself, results in a CPU stall.  This is
    no hypothetical problem but actually triggered by syzkaller fuzzer.
    
    This patch tries to fix the issue again.  Now we call
    hrtimer_try_to_cancel() at both start and stop functions so that it
    won't fall into a deadlock, yet giving some chance to cancel the queue
    if the functions have been called outside the callback.  The proper
    hrtimer_cancel() is called in anyway at closing, so this should be
    enough.

    unix: correctly track in-flight fds in sending process user_struct
    
    The commit referenced in the Fixes tag incorrectly accounted the number
    of in-flight fds over a unix domain socket to the original opener
    of the file-descriptor. This allows another process to arbitrary
    deplete the original file-openers resource limit for the maximum of
    open files. Instead the sending processes and its struct cred should
    be credited.
    
    To do so, we add a reference counted struct user_struct pointer to the
    scm_fp_list and use it to account for the number of inflight unix fds.

    memory. On small systems it may be tricky to set the pipe max size to
    prevent this from happening.
    
    This patch makes it possible to enforce a per-user soft limit above
    which new pipes will be limited to a single page, effectively limiting
    them to 4 kB each, as well as a hard limit above which no new pipes may
    be created for this user. This has the effect of protecting the system
    against memory abuse without hurting other users, and still allowing
    pipes to work correctly though with less data at once.
    
    The limit are controlled by two new sysctls : pipe-user-pages-soft, and
    pipe-user-pages-hard. Both may be disabled by setting them to zero. The
    default soft limit allows the default number of FDs per process (1024)
    to create pipes of the default size (64kB), thus reaching a limit of 64MB
    before starting to create only smaller pipes. With 256 processes limited
    to 1024 FDs each, this results in 1024*64kB + (256*1024 - 1024) * 4kB =
    1084 MB of memory allocated for a user. The hard limit is disabled by
    default to avoid breaking existing applications that make intensive use
    of pipes (eg: for splicing).

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Sanitize special-purpose register values on guest exit
    
    Thomas Huth discovered that a guest could cause a hard hang of a
    host CPU by setting the Instruction Authority Mask Register (IAMR)
    to a suitable value.  It turns out that this is because when the
    code was added to context-switch the new special-purpose registers
    (SPRs) that were added in POWER8, we forgot to add code to ensure
    that they were restored to a sane value on guest exit.
    
    This adds code to set those registers where a bad value could
    compromise the execution of the host kernel to a suitable neutral
    value on guest exit.

    netfilter: x_tables: fix unconditional helper
    
    Ben Hawkes says:
    
     In the mark_source_chains function (net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_tables.c) it
     is possible for a user-supplied ipt_entry structure to have a large
     next_offset field. This field is not bounds checked prior to writing a
     counter value at the supplied offset.
    
    Problem is that mark_source_chains should not have been called --
    the rule doesn't have a next entry, so its supposed to return
    an absolute verdict of either ACCEPT or DROP.
    
    However, the function conditional() doesn't work as the name implies.
    It only checks that the rule is using wildcard address matching.
    
    However, an unconditional rule must also not be using any matches
    (no -m args).
    
    The underflow validator only checked the addresses, therefore
    passing the 'unconditional absolute verdict' test, while
    mark_source_chains also tested for presence of matches, and thus
    proceeeded to the next (not-existent) rule.
    
    Unify this so that all the callers have same idea of 'unconditional rule'.

    ipv4: Don't do expensive useless work during inetdev destroy.
    
    When an inetdev is destroyed, every address assigned to the interface
    is removed.  And in this scenerio we do two pointless things which can
    be very expensive if the number of assigned interfaces is large:
    
    1) Address promotion.  We are deleting all addresses, so there is no
       point in doing this.
    
    2) A full nf conntrack table purge for every address.  We only need to
       do this once, as is already caught by the existing
       masq_dev_notifier so masq_inet_event() can skip this.

    x86/iopl/64: Properly context-switch IOPL on Xen PV
    
    On Xen PV, regs->flags doesn't reliably reflect IOPL and the
    exit-to-userspace code doesn't change IOPL.  We need to context
    switch it manually.
    
    I'm doing this without going through paravirt because this is
    specific to Xen PV.  After the dust settles, we can merge this with
    the 32-bit code, tidy up the iopl syscall implementation, and remove
    the set_iopl pvop entirely.
    
    Fixes XSA-171.

commit 8b8addf891de8a00e4d39fc32f93f7c5eb8feceb

Date:   Thu Mar 10 20:51:00 2016 +0100

    x86/mm/32: Enable full randomization on i386 and X86_32
    
    Currently on i386 and on X86_64 when emulating X86_32 in legacy mode, only
    the stack and the executable are randomized but not other mmapped files
    (libraries, vDSO, etc.). This patch enables randomization for the
    libraries, vDSO and mmap requests on i386 and in X86_32 in legacy mode.
    
    By default on i386 there are 8 bits for the randomization of the libraries,
    vDSO and mmaps which only uses 1MB of VA.
    
    This patch preserves the original randomness, using 1MB of VA out of 3GB or
    4GB. We think that 1MB out of 3GB is not a big cost for having the ASLR.
    
    The first obvious security benefit is that all objects are randomized (not
    only the stack and the executable) in legacy mode which highly increases
    the ASLR effectiveness, otherwise the attackers may use these
    non-randomized areas. But also sensitive setuid/setgid applications are
    more secure because currently, attackers can disable the randomization of
    these applications by setting the ulimit stack to "unlimited". This is a
    very old and widely known trick to disable the ASLR in i386 which has been
    allowed for too long.
    
    Another trick used to disable the ASLR was to set the ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE
    personality flag, but fortunately this doesn't work on setuid/setgid
    applications because there is security checks which clear Security-relevant
    flags.
    
    This patch always randomizes the mmap_legacy_base address, removing the
    possibility to disable the ASLR by setting the stack to "unlimited".

    KVM: MTRR: remove MSR 0x2f8
    
    MSR 0x2f8 accessed the 124th Variable Range MTRR ever since MTRR support
    was introduced by 9ba075a664df ("KVM: MTRR support").
    
    0x2f8 became harmful when 910a6aae4e2e ("KVM: MTRR: exactly define the
    size of variable MTRRs") shrinked the array of VR MTRRs from 256 to 8,
    which made access to index 124 out of bounds.  The surrounding code only
    WARNs in this situation, thus the guest gained a limited read/write
    access to struct kvm_arch_vcpu.
    
    0x2f8 is not a valid VR MTRR MSR, because KVM has/advertises only 16 VR
    MTRR MSRs, 0x200-0x20f.  Every VR MTRR is set up using two MSRs, 0x2f8
    was treated as a PHYSBASE and 0x2f9 would be its PHYSMASK, but 0x2f9 was
    not implemented in KVM, therefore 0x2f8 could never do anything useful
    and getting rid of it is safe.
    
    This fixes CVE-2016-3713.

    In case bind() works, but a later error forces bailing
    in probe() in error cases work and a timer may be scheduled.
    They must be killed. This fixes an error case related to
    the double free reported in

    usbnet_link_change will call schedule_work and should be

    scheduled work referring to a netdev which has gone away.
    
    Instead of making the call conditional, we can just defer
    it to usbnet_probe, using the driver_info flag made for

    USB: usbip: fix potential out-of-bounds write
    
    Fix potential out-of-bounds write to urb->transfer_buffer
    usbip handles network communication directly in the kernel. When receiving a
    packet from its peer, usbip code parses headers according to protocol. As
    part of this parsing urb->actual_length is filled. Since the input for
    urb->actual_length comes from the network, it should be treated as untrusted.
    Any entity controlling the network may put any value in the input and the
    preallocated urb->transfer_buffer may not be large enough to hold the data.
    Thus, the malicious entity is able to write arbitrary data to kernel memory.

Author: Dan Carpenter <dan.carpenter@oracle.com>
Date:   Thu Jun 16 15:48:57 2016 +0100

    KEYS: potential uninitialized variable
    
    If __key_link_begin() failed then "edit" would be uninitialized.  I've
    added a check to fix that.
    
    This allows a random user to crash the kernel, though it's quite
    difficult to achieve.  There are three ways it can be done as the user
    would have to cause an error to occur in __key_link():
    
     (1) Cause the kernel to run out of memory.  In practice, this is difficult
         to achieve without ENOMEM cropping up elsewhere and aborting the
         attempt.
    
     (2) Revoke the destination keyring between the keyring ID being looked up
         and it being tested for revocation.  In practice, this is difficult to
         time correctly because the KEYCTL_REJECT function can only be used
         from the request-key upcall process.  Further, users can only make use
         of what's in /sbin/request-key.conf, though this does including a
         rejection debugging test - which means that the destination keyring
         has to be the caller's session keyring in practice.
    
     (3) Have just enough key quota available to create a key, a new session
         keyring for the upcall and a link in the session keyring, but not then
         sufficient quota to create a link in the nominated destination keyring
         so that it fails with EDQUOT.
    
    The bug can be triggered using option (3) above using something like the
    following:
    
    	echo 80 >/proc/sys/kernel/keys/root_maxbytes
    	keyctl request2 user debug:fred negate @t
    
    The above sets the quota to something much lower (80) to make the bug
    easier to trigger, but this is dependent on the system.  Note also that
    the name of the keyring created contains a random number that may be
    between 1 and 10 characters in size, so may throw the test off by
    changing the amount of quota used.
    
    Assuming the failure occurs, something like the following will be seen:
    
    	kfree_debugcheck: out of range ptr 6b6b6b6b6b6b6b68h

    bpf: fix double-fdput in replace_map_fd_with_map_ptr()
    
    When bpf(BPF_PROG_LOAD, ...) was invoked with a BPF program whose bytecode
    references a non-map file descriptor as a map file descriptor, the error
    handling code called fdput() twice instead of once (in __bpf_map_get() and
    in replace_map_fd_with_map_ptr()). If the file descriptor table of the
    current task is shared, this causes f_count to be decremented too much,
    allowing the struct file to be freed while it is still in use
    (use-after-free). This can be exploited to gain root privileges by an
    unprivileged user.
    
    This bug was introduced in
    commit 0246e64d9a5f ("bpf: handle pseudo BPF_LD_IMM64 insn"), but is only
    exploitable since
    commit 1be7f75d1668 ("bpf: enable non-root eBPF programs") because
    previously, CAP_SYS_ADMIN was required to reach the vulnerable code.

    IB/security: Restrict use of the write() interface
    
    The drivers/infiniband stack uses write() as a replacement for
    bi-directional ioctl().  This is not safe. There are ways to
    trigger write calls that result in the return structure that
    is normally written to user space being shunted off to user
    specified kernel memory instead.
    
    For the immediate repair, detect and deny suspicious accesses to
    the write API.
    
    For long term, update the user space libraries and the kernel API
    to something that doesn't present the same security vulnerabilities
    (likely a structured ioctl() interface).
    
    The impacted uAPI interfaces are generally only available if
    hardware from drivers/infiniband is installed in the system.

    [media] videobuf2-v4l2: Verify planes array in buffer dequeueing
    
    When a buffer is being dequeued using VIDIOC_DQBUF IOCTL, the exact buffer
    which will be dequeued is not known until the buffer has been removed from
    the queue. The number of planes is specific to a buffer, not to the queue.
    
    This does lead to the situation where multi-plane buffers may be requested
    and queued with n planes, but VIDIOC_DQBUF IOCTL may be passed an argument
    struct with fewer planes.
    
    __fill_v4l2_buffer() however uses the number of planes from the dequeued
    videobuf2 buffer, overwriting kernel memory (the m.planes array allocated
    in video_usercopy() in v4l2-ioctl.c)  if the user provided fewer
    planes than the dequeued buffer had. Oops!

    [media] vb2: core: Skip planes array verification if pb is NULL
    
    An earlier patch fixing an input validation issue introduced another
    issue: vb2_core_dqbuf() is called with pb argument value NULL in some
    cases, causing a NULL pointer dereference. Fix this by skipping the
    verification as there's nothing to verify.

    net: fix a kernel infoleak in x25 module
    
    Stack object "dte_facilities" is allocated in x25_rx_call_request(),
    which is supposed to be initialized in x25_negotiate_facilities.
    However, 5 fields (8 bytes in total) are not initialized. This
    object is then copied to userland via copy_to_user, thus infoleak
    occurs.

    This oops happens with the namespace_sem held and can be triggered by
    non-root users.  An all around not pleasant experience.
    
    To avoid this scenario when finding the appropriate source mount to
    copy stop the walk up the mnt_master chain when the first source mount
    is encountered.
    
    Further rewrite the walk up the last_source mnt_master chain so that
    it is clear what is going on.
    
    The reason why the first source mount is special is that it it's
    mnt_parent is not a mount in the dest_mnt propagation tree, and as
    such termination conditions based up on the dest_mnt mount propgation
    tree do not make sense.
    
    To avoid other kinds of confusion last_dest is not changed when
    computing last_source.  last_dest is only used once in propagate_one
    and that is above the point of the code being modified, so changing
    the global variable is meaningless and confusing.

    percpu: fix synchronization between synchronous map extension and chunk destruction
    
    For non-atomic allocations, pcpu_alloc() can try to extend the area
    map synchronously after dropping pcpu_lock; however, the extension
    wasn't synchronized against chunk destruction and the chunk might get
    freed while extension is in progress.
    
    This patch fixes the bug by putting most of non-atomic allocations
    under pcpu_alloc_mutex to synchronize against pcpu_balance_work which
    is responsible for async chunk management including destruction.

    percpu: fix synchronization between chunk->map_extend_work and chunk destruction
    
    Atomic allocations can trigger async map extensions which is serviced
    by chunk->map_extend_work.  pcpu_balance_work which is responsible for
    destroying idle chunks wasn't synchronizing properly against
    chunk->map_extend_work and may end up freeing the chunk while the work
    item is still in flight.
    
    This patch fixes the bug by rolling async map extension operations
    into pcpu_balance_work.

    ppp: take reference on channels netns
    
    Let channels hold a reference on their network namespace.
    Some channel types, like ppp_async and ppp_synctty, can have their
    userspace controller running in a different namespace. Therefore they
    can't rely on them to preclude their netns from being removed from
    under them.

    get_rock_ridge_filename(): handle malformed NM entries
    
    Payloads of NM entries are not supposed to contain NUL.  When we run
    into such, only the part prior to the first NUL goes into the
    concatenation (i.e. the directory entry name being encoded by a bunch
    of NM entries).  We do stop when the amount collected so far + the
    claimed amount in the current NM entry exceed 254.  So far, so good,
    but what we return as the total length is the sum of *claimed*
    sizes, not the actual amount collected.  And that can grow pretty
    large - not unlimited, since you'd need to put CE entries in
    between to be able to get more than the maximum that could be
    contained in one isofs directory entry / continuation chunk and
    we are stop once we'd encountered 32 CEs, but you can get about 8Kb
    easily.  And that's what will be passed to readdir callback as the
    name length.  8Kb __copy_to_user() from a buffer allocated by
    __get_free_page()

    mm: remove gup_flags FOLL_WRITE games from __get_user_pages()
    
    This is an ancient bug that was actually attempted to be fixed once
    (badly) by me eleven years ago in commit 4ceb5db9757a ("Fix
    get_user_pages() race for write access") but that was then undone due to
    problems on s390 by commit f33ea7f404e5 ("fix get_user_pages bug").
    
    In the meantime, the s390 situation has long been fixed, and we can now
    fix it by checking the pte_dirty() bit properly (and do it better).  The
    s390 dirty bit was implemented in abf09bed3cce ("s390/mm: implement
    software dirty bits") which made it into v3.9.  Earlier kernels will
    have to look at the page state itself.
    
    Also, the VM has become more scalable, and what used a purely
    theoretical race back then has become easier to trigger.
    
    To fix it, we introduce a new internal FOLL_COW flag to mark the "yes,
    we already did a COW" rather than play racy games with FOLL_WRITE that
    is very fundamental, and then use the pte dirty flag to validate that
    the FOLL_COW flag is still valid.

    media: fix airspy usb probe error path
    
    Fix a memory leak on probe error of the airspy usb device driver.
    
    The problem is triggered when more than 64 usb devices register with
    v4l2 of type VFL_TYPE_SDR or VFL_TYPE_SUBDEV.
    
    The memory leak is caused by the probe function of the airspy driver
    mishandeling errors and not freeing the corresponding control structures
    when an error occours registering the device to v4l2 core.
    
    A badusb device can emulate 64 of these devices, and then through
    continual emulated connect/disconnect of the 65th device, cause the
    kernel to run out of RAM and crash the kernel, thus causing a local DOS
    vulnerability.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Save/restore TM state in H_CEDE
    
    It turns out that if the guest does a H_CEDE while the CPU is in
    a transactional state, and the H_CEDE does a nap, and the nap
    loses the architected state of the CPU (which is is allowed to do),
    then we lose the checkpointed state of the virtual CPU.  In addition,
    the transactional-memory state recorded in the MSR gets reset back
    to non-transactional, and when we try to return to the guest, we take
    a TM bad thing type of program interrupt because we are trying to
    transition from non-transactional to transactional with a hrfid
    instruction, which is not permitted.
    
    The result of the program interrupt occurring at that point is that
    the host CPU will hang in an infinite loop with interrupts disabled.
    Thus this is a denial of service vulnerability in the host which can
    be triggered by any guest (and depending on the guest kernel, it can
    potentially triggered by unprivileged userspace in the guest).
    
    This vulnerability has been assigned the ID CVE-2016-5412.
    
    To fix this, we save the TM state before napping and restore it
    on exit from the nap, when handling a H_CEDE in real mode.  The
    case where H_CEDE exits to host virtual mode is already OK (as are
    other hcalls which exit to host virtual mode) because the exit
    path saves the TM state.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Pull out TM state save/restore into separate procedures
    
    This moves the transactional memory state save and restore sequences
    out of the guest entry/exit paths into separate procedures.  This is
    so that these sequences can be used in going into and out of nap
    in a subsequent patch.
    
    The only code changes here are (a) saving and restore LR on the
    stack, since these new procedures get called with a bl instruction,
    (b) explicitly saving r1 into the PACA instead of assuming that
    HSTATE_HOST_R1(r13) is already set, and (c) removing an unnecessary
    and redundant setting of MSR[TM] that should have been removed by
    commit 9d4d0bdd9e0a ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Add transactional memory
    support", 2013-09-24) but wasn't.

    tcp: make challenge acks less predictable
    
    Yue Cao claims that current host rate limiting of challenge ACKS
    (RFC 5961) could leak enough information to allow a patient attacker
    to hijack TCP sessions. He will soon provide details in an academic
    paper.
    
    This patch increases the default limit from 100 to 1000, and adds
    some randomization so that the attacker can no longer hijack
    sessions without spending a considerable amount of probes.
    
    Based on initial analysis and patch from Linus.
    
    Note that we also have per socket rate limiting, so it is tempting
    to remove the host limit in the future.
    
    v2: randomize the count of challenge acks per second, not the period.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 8e96a87c5431c256feb65bcfc5aec92d9f7839b6
Author: Cyril Bur <cyrilbur@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Jun 17 14:58:34 2016 +1000

    powerpc/tm: Always reclaim in start_thread() for exec() class syscalls
    
    Userspace can quite legitimately perform an exec() syscall with a
    suspended transaction. exec() does not return to the old process, rather
    it load a new one and starts that, the expectation therefore is that the
    new process starts not in a transaction. Currently exec() is not treated
    any differently to any other syscall which creates problems.
    
    Firstly it could allow a new process to start with a suspended
    transaction for a binary that no longer exists. This means that the
    checkpointed state won't be valid and if the suspended transaction were
    ever to be resumed and subsequently aborted (a possibility which is
    exceedingly likely as exec()ing will likely doom the transaction) the
    new process will jump to invalid state.
    
    Secondly the incorrect attempt to keep the transactional state while
    still zeroing state for the new process creates at least two TM Bad
    Things. The first triggers on the rfid to return to userspace as
    start_thread() has given the new process a 'clean' MSR but the suspend
    will still be set in the hardware MSR. The second TM Bad Thing triggers
    in __switch_to() as the processor is still transactionally suspended but
    __switch_to() wants to zero the TM sprs for the new process.
    
    This is an example of the outcome of calling exec() with a suspended
    transaction. Note the first 700 is likely the first TM bad thing
    decsribed earlier only the kernel can't report it as we've loaded
    userspace registers. c000000000009980 is the rfid in
    fast_exception_return()

    The sclp_ctl_ioctl_sccb function uses two copy_from_user calls to

    audit: fix a double fetch in audit_log_single_execve_arg()
    
    There is a double fetch problem in audit_log_single_execve_arg()
    where we first check the execve(2) argumnets for any "bad" characters
    which would require hex encoding and then re-fetch the arguments for
    logging in the audit record[1].  Of course this leaves a window of
    opportunity for an unsavory application to munge with the data.
    
    This patch reworks things by only fetching the argument data once[2]
    into a buffer where it is scanned and logged into the audit
    records(s).  In addition to fixing the double fetch, this patch
    improves on the original code in a few other ways: better handling
    of large arguments which require encoding, stricter record length
    checking, and some performance improvements (completely unverified,
    but we got rid of some strlen() calls, that's got to be a good
    thing).
    
    As part of the development of this patch, I've also created a basic
    regression test for the audit-testsuite, the test can be tracked on
    GitHub at the following link:
    
     * https://github.com/linux-audit/audit-testsuite/issues/25
    
    [1] If you pay careful attention, there is actually a triple fetch
    problem due to a strnlen_user() call at the top of the function.
    
    [2] This is a tiny white lie, we do make a call to strnlen_user()
    prior to fetching the argument data.  I don't like it, but due to the
    way the audit record is structured we really have no choice unless we
    copy the entire argument at once (which would require a rather
    wasteful allocation).  The good news is that with this patch the
    kernel no longer relies on this strnlen_user() value for anything
    beyond recording it in the log, we also update it with a trustworthy
    value whenever possible.

    ovl: verify upper dentry before unlink and rename
    
    Unlink and rename in overlayfs checked the upper dentry for staleness by
    verifying upper->d_parent against upperdir.  However the dentry can go
    stale also by being unhashed, for example.
    
    Expand the verification to actually look up the name again (under parent
    lock) and check if it matches the upper dentry.  This matches what the VFS
    does before passing the dentry to filesytem's unlink/rename methods, which
    excludes any inconsistency caused by overlayfs.

    mnt: Add a per mount namespace limit on the number of mounts
    
    CAI Qian <caiqian@redhat.com> pointed out that the semantics
    of shared subtrees make it possible to create an exponentially
    increasing number of mounts in a mount namespace.
    
        mkdir /tmp/1 /tmp/2
        mount --make-rshared /
        for i in $(seq 1 20) ; do mount --bind /tmp/1 /tmp/2 ; done
    
    Will create create 2^20 or 1048576 mounts, which is a practical problem
    as some people have managed to hit this by accident.
    
    As such CVE-2016-6213 was assigned.
    
    Ian Kent <raven@themaw.net> described the situation for autofs users
    as follows:

    So I am setting the default number of mounts allowed per mount
    namespace at 100,000.  This is more than enough for any use case I
    know of, but small enough to quickly stop an exponential increase
    in mounts.  Which should be perfect to catch misconfigurations and
    malfunctioning programs.
    
    For anyone who needs a higher limit this can be changed by writing
    to the new /proc/sys/fs/mount-max sysctl.

    aacraid: Check size values after double-fetch from user
    
    In aacraid's ioctl_send_fib() we do two fetches from userspace, one the
    get the fib header's size and one for the fib itself. Later we use the
    size field from the second fetch to further process the fib. If for some
    reason the size from the second fetch is different than from the first
    fix, we may encounter an out-of- bounds access in aac_fib_send(). We
    also check the sender size to insure it is not out of bounds. This was
    reported in https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116751 and was
    assigned CVE-2016-6480.

commit bb1fceca22492109be12640d49f5ea5a544c6bb4
Author: Eric Dumazet <edumazet@google.com>
Date:   Wed Aug 17 05:56:26 2016 -0700

    tcp: fix use after free in tcp_xmit_retransmit_queue()
    
    When tcp_sendmsg() allocates a fresh and empty skb, it puts it at the
    tail of the write queue using tcp_add_write_queue_tail()
    
    Then it attempts to copy user data into this fresh skb.
    
    If the copy fails, we undo the work and remove the fresh skb.
    
    Unfortunately, this undo lacks the change done to tp->highest_sack and
    we can leave a dangling pointer (to a freed skb)
    
    Later, tcp_xmit_retransmit_queue() can dereference this pointer and
    access freed memory. For regular kernels where memory is not unmapped,
    this might cause SACK bugs because tcp_highest_sack_seq() is buggy,
    returning garbage instead of tp->snd_nxt, but with various debug
    features like CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC, this can crash the kernel.
    
    This bug was found by Marco Grassi thanks to syzkaller.

    net: add recursion limit to GRO
    
    Currently, GRO can do unlimited recursion through the gro_receive
    handlers.  This was fixed for tunneling protocols by limiting tunnel GRO
    to one level with encap_mark, but both VLAN and TEB still have this
    problem.  Thus, the kernel is vulnerable to a stack overflow, if we
    receive a packet composed entirely of VLAN headers.
    
    This patch adds a recursion counter to the GRO layer to prevent stack
    overflow.  When a gro_receive function hits the recursion limit, GRO is
    aborted for this skb and it is processed normally.  This recursion
    counter is put in the GRO CB, but could be turned into a percpu counter
    if we run out of space in the CB.

    KEYS: Fix short sprintf buffer in /proc/keys show function
    
    This fixes CVE-2016-7042.
    
    Fix a short sprintf buffer in proc_keys_show().  If the gcc stack protector
    is turned on, this can cause a panic due to stack corruption.
    
    The problem is that xbuf[] is not big enough to hold a 64-bit timeout
    rendered as weeks:
    
    	(gdb) p 0xffffffffffffffffULL/(60*60*24*7)
    	$2 = 30500568904943
    
    That's 14 chars plus NUL, not 11 chars plus NUL.
    
    Expand the buffer to 16 chars.
    
    I think the unpatched code apparently works if the stack-protector is not
    enabled because on a 32-bit machine the buffer won't be overflowed and on a
    64-bit machine there's a 64-bit aligned pointer at one side and an int that
    isn't checked again on the other side.
    
    The panic incurred looks something like:
    
    Kernel panic - not syncing: stack-protector: Kernel stack is corrupted in: ffffffff81352ebe

    posix_acl: Clear SGID bit when setting file permissions
    
    When file permissions are modified via chmod(2) and the user is not in
    the owning group or capable of CAP_FSETID, the setgid bit is cleared in
    inode_change_ok().  Setting a POSIX ACL via setxattr(2) sets the file
    permissions as well as the new ACL, but doesn't clear the setgid bit in
    a similar way; this allows to bypass the check in chmod(2).  Fix that.

    This problem can occur in the following situation:
    
    open()
     - pread()
        - .seq_start()
           - iter = kmalloc() // succeeds
           - seqf->private = iter
        - .seq_stop()
           - kfree(seqf->private)
     - pread()
        - .seq_start()
           - iter = kmalloc() // fails
        - .seq_stop()
           - class_dev_iter_exit(seqf->private) // boom! old pointer
    
    As the comment in disk_seqf_stop() says, stop is called even if start
    failed, so we need to reinitialise the private pointer to NULL when seq
    iteration stops.
    
    An alternative would be to set the private pointer to NULL when the
    kmalloc() in disk_seqf_start() fails.

    block: fix use-after-free in sys_ioprio_get()
    
    get_task_ioprio() accesses the task->io_context without holding the task
    lock and thus can race with exit_io_context(), leading to a
    use-after-free. The reproducer below hits this within a few seconds on
    my 4-core QEMU VM:
    
    #define _GNU_SOURCE
    #include <assert.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <sys/syscall.h>
    #include <sys/wait.h>
    
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
    	pid_t pid, child;
    	long nproc, i;
    
    	/* ioprio_set(IOPRIO_WHO_PROCESS, 0, IOPRIO_PRIO_VALUE(IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE, 0)); */
    	syscall(SYS_ioprio_set, 1, 0, 0x6000);
    
    	nproc = sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN);
    
    	for (i = 0; i < nproc; i++) {
    		pid = fork();
    		assert(pid != -1);
    		if (pid == 0) {
    			for (;;) {
    				pid = fork();
    				assert(pid != -1);
    				if (pid == 0) {
    					_exit(0);
    				} else {
    					child = wait(NULL);
    					assert(child == pid);
    				}
    			}
    		}
    
    		pid = fork();
    		assert(pid != -1);
    		if (pid == 0) {
    			for (;;) {
    				/* ioprio_get(IOPRIO_WHO_PGRP, 0); */
    				syscall(SYS_ioprio_get, 2, 0);
    			}
    		}
    	}
    
    	for (;;) {
    		/* ioprio_get(IOPRIO_WHO_PGRP, 0); */
    		syscall(SYS_ioprio_get, 2, 0);
    	}
    
    	return 0;
    }
    
    This gets us KASAN dumps like this:

    Fix it by grabbing the task lock while we poke at the io_context.

    usb: gadget: f_fs: Fix use-after-free
    
    When using asynchronous read or write operations on the USB endpoints the
    issuer of the IO request is notified by calling the ki_complete() callback
    of the submitted kiocb when the URB has been completed.
    
    Calling this ki_complete() callback will free kiocb. Make sure that the
    structure is no longer accessed beyond that point, otherwise undefined
    behaviour might occur.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 8d4a2ec1e0b41b0cf9a0c5cd4511da7f8e4f3de2
Author: Jerome Marchand <jmarchan@redhat.com>
Date:   Wed Apr 6 14:06:48 2016 +0100

    assoc_array: don't call compare_object() on a node
    
    Changes since V1: fixed the description and added KASan warning.
    
    In assoc_array_insert_into_terminal_node(), we call the
    compare_object() method on all non-empty slots, even when they're
    not leaves, passing a pointer to an unexpected structure to
    compare_object(). Currently it causes an out-of-bound read access
    in keyring_compare_object detected by KASan (see below). The issue
    is easily reproduced with keyutils testsuite.
    Only call compare_object() when the slot is a leave.
    
    KASan warning:

    HID: core: prevent out-of-bound readings
    
    Plugging a Logitech DJ receiver with KASAN activated raises a bunch of
    out-of-bound readings.
    
    The fields are allocated up to MAX_USAGE, meaning that potentially, we do
    not have enough fields to fit the incoming values.
    Add checks and silence KASAN.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 8148a73c9901a8794a50f950083c00ccf97d43b3
Author: Mathias Krause <minipli@googlemail.com>
Date:   Thu May 5 16:22:26 2016 -0700

    proc: prevent accessing /proc/<PID>/environ until it's ready
    
    If /proc/<PID>/environ gets read before the envp[] array is fully set up
    in create_{aout,elf,elf_fdpic,flat}_tables(), we might end up trying to
    read more bytes than are actually written, as env_start will already be
    set but env_end will still be zero, making the range calculation
    underflow, allowing to read beyond the end of what has been written.
    
    Fix this as it is done for /proc/<PID>/cmdline by testing env_end for
    zero.  It is, apparently, intentionally set last in create_*_tables().
    
    This bug was found by the PaX size_overflow plugin that detected the
    arithmetic underflow of 'this_len = env_end - (env_start + src)' when
    env_end is still zero.
    
    The expected consequence is that userland trying to access
    /proc/<PID>/environ of a not yet fully set up process may get
    inconsistent data as we're in the middle of copying in the environment
    variables.

    netfilter: nfnetlink: correctly validate length of batch messages
    
    If nlh->nlmsg_len is zero then an infinite loop is triggered because
    'skb_pull(skb, msglen);' pulls zero bytes.
    
    The calculation in nlmsg_len() underflows if 'nlh->nlmsg_len <
    NLMSG_HDRLEN' which bypasses the length validation and will later
    trigger an out-of-bound read.
    
    If the length validation does fail then the malformed batch message is
    copied back to userspace. However, we cannot do this because the
    nlh->nlmsg_len can be invalid. This leads to an out-of-bounds read in
    netlink_ack:

    net: ping: check minimum size on ICMP header length
    
    Prior to commit c0371da6047a ("put iov_iter into msghdr") in v3.19, there
    was no check that the iovec contained enough bytes for an ICMP header,
    and the read loop would walk across neighboring stack contents. Since the
    iov_iter conversion, bad arguments are noticed, but the returned error is
    EFAULT. Returning EINVAL is a clearer error and also solves the problem
    prior to v3.19.
    
    This was found using trinity with KASAN on v3.18:

    tipc: check minimum bearer MTU
    
    Qian Zhang (张谦) reported a potential socket buffer overflow in
    tipc_msg_build() which is also known as CVE-2016-8632: due to
    insufficient checks, a buffer overflow can occur if MTU is too short for
    even tipc headers. As anyone can set device MTU in a user/net namespace,
    this issue can be abused by a regular user.
    
    As agreed in the discussion on Ben Hutchings' original patch, we should
    check the MTU at the moment a bearer is attached rather than for each
    processed packet. We also need to repeat the check when bearer MTU is
    adjusted to new device MTU. UDP case also needs a check to avoid
    overflow when calculating bearer MTU.

    firewire: net: guard against rx buffer overflows
    
    The IP-over-1394 driver firewire-net lacked input validation when
    handling incoming fragmented datagrams.  A maliciously formed fragment
    with a respectively large datagram_offset would cause a memcpy past the
    datagram buffer.
    
    So, drop any packets carrying a fragment with offset + length larger
    than datagram_size.
    
    In addition, ensure that
      - GASP header, unfragmented encapsulation header, or fragment
        encapsulation header actually exists before we access it,
      - the encapsulated datagram or fragment is of nonzero size.

    tcp: take care of truncations done by sk_filter()
    
    With syzkaller help, Marco Grassi found a bug in TCP stack,
    crashing in tcp_collapse()
    
    Root cause is that sk_filter() can truncate the incoming skb,
    but TCP stack was not really expecting this to happen.
    It probably was expecting a simple DROP or ACCEPT behavior.
    
    We first need to make sure no part of TCP header could be removed.
    Then we need to adjust TCP_SKB_CB(skb)->end_seq
    
    Many thanks to syzkaller team and Marco for giving us a reproducer.

    mpi: Fix NULL ptr dereference in mpi_powm() [ver #3]
    
    This fixes CVE-2016-8650.
    
    If mpi_powm() is given a zero exponent, it wants to immediately return
    either 1 or 0, depending on the modulus.  However, if the result was
    initalised with zero limb space, no limbs space is allocated and a
    NULL-pointer exception ensues.
    
    Fix this by allocating a minimal amount of limb space for the result when
    the 0-exponent case when the result is 1 and not touching the limb space
    when the result is 0.
    
    This affects the use of RSA keys and X.509 certificates that carry them.

    packet: fix race condition in packet_set_ring
    
    When packet_set_ring creates a ring buffer it will initialize a
    struct timer_list if the packet version is TPACKET_V3. This value
    can then be raced by a different thread calling setsockopt to
    set the version to TPACKET_V1 before packet_set_ring has finished.
    
    This leads to a use-after-free on a function pointer in the
    struct timer_list when the socket is closed as the previously
    initialized timer will not be deleted.
    
    The bug is fixed by taking lock_sock(sk) in packet_setsockopt when
    changing the packet version while also taking the lock at the start
    of packet_set_ring.

    brcmfmac: avoid potential stack overflow in brcmf_cfg80211_start_ap()
    
    User-space can choose to omit NL80211_ATTR_SSID and only provide raw
    IE TLV data. When doing so it can provide SSID IE with length exceeding
    the allowed size. The driver further processes this IE copying it
    into a local variable without checking the length. Hence stack can be
    corrupted and used as exploit.

    tunnels: Don't apply GRO to multiple layers of encapsulation.
    
    When drivers express support for TSO of encapsulated packets, they
    only mean that they can do it for one layer of encapsulation.
    Supporting additional levels would mean updating, at a minimum,
    more IP length fields and they are unaware of this.
    
    No encapsulation device expresses support for handling offloaded
    encapsulated packets, so we won't generate these types of frames
    in the transmit path. However, GRO doesn't have a check for
    multiple levels of encapsulation and will attempt to build them.
    
    UDP tunnel GRO actually does prevent this situation but it only
    handles multiple UDP tunnels stacked on top of each other. This
    generalizes that solution to prevent any kind of tunnel stacking
    that would cause problems.

    staging/android/ion : fix a race condition in the ion driver
    
    There is a use-after-free problem in the ion driver.
    This is caused by a race condition in the ion_ioctl()
    function.
    
    A handle has ref count of 1 and two tasks on different
    cpus calls ION_IOC_FREE simultaneously.
    
    cpu 0                                   cpu 1
    -------------------------------------------------------
    ion_handle_get_by_id()
    (ref == 2)
                                ion_handle_get_by_id()
                                (ref == 3)
    
    ion_free()
    (ref == 2)
    
    ion_handle_put()
    (ref == 1)
    
                                ion_free()
                                (ref == 0 so ion_handle_destroy() is
                                called
                                and the handle is freed.)
    
                                ion_handle_put() is called and it
                                decreases the slub's next free pointer
    
    The problem is detected as an unaligned access in the
    spin lock functions since it uses load exclusive
     instruction. In some cases it corrupts the slub's
    free pointer which causes a mis-aligned access to the
    next free pointer.(kmalloc returns a pointer like
    ffffc0745b4580aa). And it causes lots of other
    hard-to-debug problems.
    
    This symptom is caused since the first member in the
    ion_handle structure is the reference count and the
    ion driver decrements the reference after it has been
    freed.
    
    To fix this problem client->lock mutex is extended
    to protect all the codes that uses the handle.

    One cgroup maintainer mentioned that "cgroup is trying to offline
    a cpuset css, which takes place under cgroup_mutex.  The offlining
    ends up trying to drain active usages of a sysctl table which apprently
    is not happening."
    The real reason is that proc_sys_readdir doesn't drop reference added
    by grab_header when return from !dir_emit_dots path. So this cpuset
    offline path will wait here forever.

    sctp: validate chunk len before actually using it
    
    Andrey Konovalov reported that KASAN detected that SCTP was using a slab
    beyond the boundaries. It was caused because when handling out of the
    blue packets in function sctp_sf_ootb() it was checking the chunk len
    only after already processing the first chunk, validating only for the
    2nd and subsequent ones.
    
    The fix is to just move the check upwards so it's also validated for the
    1st chunk.

    KEYS: Disallow keyrings beginning with '.' to be joined as session keyrings
    
    This fixes CVE-2016-9604.

    shadowing.  However, the patch that added the guard didn't fix
    KEYCTL_JOIN_SESSION_KEYRING.  Not only can that create dot-named keyrings,
    it can also subscribe to them as a session keyring if they grant SEARCH
    permission to the user.
    
    This, for example, allows a root process to set .builtin_trusted_keys as
    its session keyring, at which point it has full access because now the
    possessor permissions are added.  This permits root to add extra public
    keys, thereby bypassing module verification.
    
    This also affects kexec and IMA.
    
    This can be tested by (as root):
    
    	keyctl session .builtin_trusted_keys
    	keyctl add user a a @s
    	keyctl list @s
    
    which on my test box gives me:
    
    	2 keys in keyring:
    	180010936: ---lswrv     0     0 asymmetric: Build time autogenerated kernel key: ae3d4a31b82daa8e1a75b49dc2bba949fd992a05
    	801382539: --alswrv     0     0 user: a
    
    
    Fix this by rejecting names beginning with a '.' in the keyctl.

    x86/mm: Expand the exception table logic to allow new handling options
    
    Huge amounts of help from  Andy Lutomirski and Borislav Petkov to
    produce this. Andy provided the inspiration to add classes to the
    exception table with a clever bit-squeezing trick, Boris pointed
    out how much cleaner it would all be if we just had a new field.
    
    Linus Torvalds blessed the expansion with:
    
      ' I'd rather not be clever in order to save just a tiny amount of space
        in the exception table, which isn't really criticial for anybody. '
    
    The third field is another relative function pointer, this one to a
    handler that executes the actions.
    
    We start out with three handlers:
    
     1: Legacy - just jumps the to fixup IP
     2: Fault - provide the trap number in %ax to the fixup code
     3: Cleaned up legacy for the uaccess error hack

    ring-buffer: Prevent overflow of size in ring_buffer_resize()
    
    If the size passed to ring_buffer_resize() is greater than MAX_LONG - BUF_PAGE_SIZE
    then the DIV_ROUND_UP() will return zero.
    
    Here's the details:
    
      # echo 18014398509481980 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/buffer_size_kb
    
    tracing_entries_write() processes this and converts kb to bytes.
    
     18014398509481980 << 10 = 18446744073709547520
    
    and this is passed to ring_buffer_resize() as unsigned long size.
    
     size = DIV_ROUND_UP(size, BUF_PAGE_SIZE);
    
    Where DIV_ROUND_UP(a, b) is (a + b - 1)/b
    
    BUF_PAGE_SIZE is 4080 and here
    
     18446744073709547520 + 4080 - 1 = 18446744073709551599
    
    where 18446744073709551599 is still smaller than 2^64
    
     2^64 - 18446744073709551599 = 17
    
    But now 18446744073709551599 / 4080 = 4521260802379792
    
    and size = size * 4080 = 18446744073709551360
    
    This is checked to make sure its still greater than 2 * 4080,
    which it is.
    
    Then we convert to the number of buffer pages needed.
    
     nr_page = DIV_ROUND_UP(size, BUF_PAGE_SIZE)
    
    but this time size is 18446744073709551360 and
    
     2^64 - (18446744073709551360 + 4080 - 1) = -3823
    
    Thus it overflows and the resulting number is less than 4080, which makes
    
      3823 / 4080 = 0
    
    an nr_pages is set to this. As we already checked against the minimum that
    nr_pages may be, this causes the logic to fail as well, and we crash the
    kernel.
    
    There's no reason to have the two DIV_ROUND_UP() (that's just result of
    historical code changes), clean up the code and fix this bug.

    KVM: x86: drop error recovery in em_jmp_far and em_ret_far
    
    em_jmp_far and em_ret_far assumed that setting IP can only fail in 64
    bit mode, but syzkaller proved otherwise (and SDM agrees).
    Code segment was restored upon failure, but it was left uninitialized
    outside of long mode, which could lead to a leak of host kernel stack.
    We could have fixed that by always saving and restoring the CS, but we
    take a simpler approach and just break any guest that manages to fail
    as the error recovery is error-prone and modern CPUs don't need emulator
    for this.

    ALSA: pcm : Call kill_fasync() in stream lock
    
    Currently kill_fasync() is called outside the stream lock in
    snd_pcm_period_elapsed().  This is potentially racy, since the stream
    may get released even during the irq handler is running.  Although
    snd_pcm_release_substream() calls snd_pcm_drop(), this doesn't
    guarantee that the irq handler finishes, thus the kill_fasync() call
    outside the stream spin lock may be invoked after the substream is
    detached, as recently reported by KASAN.
    
    As a quick workaround, move kill_fasync() call inside the stream
    lock.  The fasync is rarely used interface, so this shouldn't have a
    big impact from the performance POV.
    
    Ideally, we should implement some sync mechanism for the proper finish
    of stream and irq handler.  But this oneliner should suffice for most
    cases, so far.

    When we free cb->skb after a dump, we do it after releasing the

    KVM: VMX: Do not BUG() on out-of-bounds guest IRQ
    
    The value of the guest_irq argument to vmx_update_pi_irte() is
    ultimately coming from a KVM_IRQFD API call. Do not BUG() in
    vmx_update_pi_irte() if the value is out-of bounds. (Especially,
    since KVM as a whole seems to hang after that.)
    
    Instead, print a message only once if we find that we don't have a
    route for a certain IRQ (which can be out-of-bounds or within the
    array).
    
    This fixes CVE-2017-1000252.

    mm: larger stack guard gap, between vmas
    
    Stack guard page is a useful feature to reduce a risk of stack smashing
    into a different mapping. We have been using a single page gap which
    is sufficient to prevent having stack adjacent to a different mapping.
    But this seems to be insufficient in the light of the stack usage in
    userspace. E.g. glibc uses as large as 64kB alloca() in many commonly
    used functions. Others use constructs liks gid_t buffer[NGROUPS_MAX]
    which is 256kB or stack strings with MAX_ARG_STRLEN.
    
    This will become especially dangerous for suid binaries and the default
    no limit for the stack size limit because those applications can be
    tricked to consume a large portion of the stack and a single glibc call
    could jump over the guard page. These attacks are not theoretical,
    unfortunatelly.
    
    Make those attacks less probable by increasing the stack guard gap
    to 1MB (on systems with 4k pages; but make it depend on the page size
    because systems with larger base pages might cap stack allocations in
    the PAGE_SIZE units) which should cover larger alloca() and VLA stack
    allocations. It is obviously not a full fix because the problem is
    somehow inherent, but it should reduce attack space a lot.
    
    One could argue that the gap size should be configurable from userspace,
    but that can be done later when somebody finds that the new 1MB is wrong
    for some special case applications.  For now, add a kernel command line
    option (stack_guard_gap) to specify the stack gap size (in page units).
    
    Implementation wise, first delete all the old code for stack guard page:
    because although we could get away with accounting one extra page in a
    stack vma, accounting a larger gap can break userspace - case in point,
    a program run with "ulimit -S -v 20000" failed when the 1MB gap was
    counted for RLIMIT_AS; similar problems could come with RLIMIT_MLOCK
    and strict non-overcommit mode.
    
    Instead of keeping gap inside the stack vma, maintain the stack guard
    gap as a gap between vmas: using vm_start_gap() in place of vm_start
    (or vm_end_gap() in place of vm_end if VM_GROWSUP) in just those few
    places which need to respect the gap - mainly arch_get_unmapped_area(),
    and and the vma tree's subtree_gap support for that.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 98da7d08850fb8bdeb395d6368ed15753304aa0c
Author: Kees Cook <keescook@chromium.org>
Date:   Fri Jun 23 15:08:57 2017 -0700

    fs/exec.c: account for argv/envp pointers
    
    When limiting the argv/envp strings during exec to 1/4 of the stack limit,
    the storage of the pointers to the strings was not included.  This means
    that an exec with huge numbers of tiny strings could eat 1/4 of the stack
    limit in strings and then additional space would be later used by the
    pointers to the strings.
    
    For example, on 32-bit with a 8MB stack rlimit, an exec with 1677721
    single-byte strings would consume less than 2MB of stack, the max (8MB /
    4) amount allowed, but the pointers to the strings would consume the
    remaining additional stack space (1677721 * 4 == 6710884).
    
    The result (1677721 + 6710884 == 8388605) would exhaust stack space
    entirely.  Controlling this stack exhaustion could result in
    pathological behavior in setuid binaries (CVE-2017-1000365).

    binfmt_elf: use ELF_ET_DYN_BASE only for PIE
    
    The ELF_ET_DYN_BASE position was originally intended to keep loaders
    away from ET_EXEC binaries.  (For example, running "/lib/ld-linux.so.2
    /bin/cat" might cause the subsequent load of /bin/cat into where the
    loader had been loaded.)
    
    With the advent of PIE (ET_DYN binaries with an INTERP Program Header),
    ELF_ET_DYN_BASE continued to be used since the kernel was only looking
    at ET_DYN.  However, since ELF_ET_DYN_BASE is traditionally set at the
    top 1/3rd of the TASK_SIZE, a substantial portion of the address space
    is unused.
    
    For 32-bit tasks when RLIMIT_STACK is set to RLIM_INFINITY, programs are
    loaded above the mmap region.  This means they can be made to collide
    (CVE-2017-1000370) or nearly collide (CVE-2017-1000371) with
    pathological stack regions.
    
    Lowering ELF_ET_DYN_BASE solves both by moving programs below the mmap
    region in all cases, and will now additionally avoid programs falling
    back to the mmap region by enforcing MAP_FIXED for program loads (i.e.
    if it would have collided with the stack, now it will fail to load
    instead of falling back to the mmap region).
    
    To allow for a lower ELF_ET_DYN_BASE, loaders (ET_DYN without INTERP)
    are loaded into the mmap region, leaving space available for either an
    ET_EXEC binary with a fixed location or PIE being loaded into mmap by
    the loader.  Only PIE programs are loaded offset from ELF_ET_DYN_BASE,
    which means architectures can now safely lower their values without risk
    of loaders colliding with their subsequently loaded programs.
    
    For 64-bit, ELF_ET_DYN_BASE is best set to 4GB to allow runtimes to use
    the entire 32-bit address space for 32-bit pointers.
    
    Thanks to PaX Team, Daniel Micay, and Rik van Riel for inspiration and
    suggestions on how to implement this solution.

    ALSA: timer: Fix missing queue indices reset at SNDRV_TIMER_IOCTL_SELECT
    
    snd_timer_user_tselect() reallocates the queue buffer dynamically, but
    it forgot to reset its indices.  Since the read may happen
    concurrently with ioctl and snd_timer_user_tselect() allocates the
    buffer via kmalloc(), this may lead to the leak of uninitialized
    kernel-space data, as spotted via KMSAN:

    ALSA: timer: Fix race between read and ioctl
    
    The read from ALSA timer device, the function snd_timer_user_tread(),
    may access to an uninitialized struct snd_timer_user fields when the
    read is concurrently performed while the ioctl like
    snd_timer_user_tselect() is invoked.  We have already fixed the races
    among ioctls via a mutex, but we seem to have forgotten the race
    between read vs ioctl.
    
    This patch simply applies (more exactly extends the already applied
    range of) tu->ioctl_lock in snd_timer_user_tread() for closing the
    race window.

    Currently, we unconditionally make page table dirty in touch_pmd().
    It may result in false-positive can_follow_write_pmd().
    
    We may avoid the situation, if we would only make the page table entry
    dirty if caller asks for write access -- FOLL_WRITE.
    
    The patch also changes touch_pud() in the same way.

    KVM: VMX: remove I/O port 0x80 bypass on Intel hosts
    
    This fixes CVE-2017-1000407.
    
    KVM allows guests to directly access I/O port 0x80 on Intel hosts.  If
    the guest floods this port with writes it generates exceptions and
    instability in the host kernel, leading to a crash.  With this change
    guest writes to port 0x80 on Intel will behave the same as they
    currently behave on AMD systems.
    
    Prevent the flooding by removing the code that sets port 0x80 as a
    passthrough port.  This is essentially the same as upstream patch
    99f85a28a78e96d28907fe036e1671a218fee597, except that patch was
    for AMD chipsets and this patch is for Intel.

    timerfd: Protect the might cancel mechanism proper
    
    The handling of the might_cancel queueing is not properly protected, so
    parallel operations on the file descriptor can race with each other and
    lead to list corruptions or use after free.
    
    Protect the context for these operations with a seperate lock.
    
    The wait queue lock cannot be reused for this because that would create a
    lock inversion scenario vs. the cancel lock. Replacing might_cancel with an
    atomic (atomic_t or atomic bit) does not help either because it still can
    race vs. the actual list operation.

    mqueue: fix a use-after-free in sys_mq_notify()
    
    The retry logic for netlink_attachskb() inside sys_mq_notify()
    is nasty and vulnerable:
    
    1) The sock refcnt is already released when retry is needed
    2) The fd is controllable by user-space because we already
       release the file refcnt
    
    so we when retry but the fd has been just closed by user-space
    during this small window, we end up calling netlink_detachskb()
    on the error path which releases the sock again, later when
    the user-space closes this socket a use-after-free could be
    triggered.
    
    Setting 'sock' to NULL here should be sufficient to fix it.

    x86/acpi: Prevent out of bound access caused by broken ACPI tables
    
    The bus_irq argument of mp_override_legacy_irq() is used as the index into
    the isa_irq_to_gsi[] array. The bus_irq argument originates from
    ACPI_MADT_TYPE_IO_APIC and ACPI_MADT_TYPE_INTERRUPT items in the ACPI
    tables, but is nowhere sanity checked.
    
    That allows broken or malicious ACPI tables to overwrite memory, which
    might cause malfunction, panic or arbitrary code execution.
    
    Add a sanity check and emit a warning when that triggers.

    xen: fix bio vec merging
    
    The current test for bio vec merging is not fully accurate and can be
    tricked into merging bios when certain grant combinations are used.
    The result of these malicious bio merges is a bio that extends past
    the memory page used by any of the originating bios.
    
    Take into account the following scenario, where a guest creates two
    grant references that point to the same mfn, ie: grant 1 -> mfn A,
    grant 2 -> mfn A.
    
    These references are then used in a PV block request, and mapped by
    the backend domain, thus obtaining two different pfns that point to
    the same mfn, pfn B -> mfn A, pfn C -> mfn A.
    
    If those grants happen to be used in two consecutive sectors of a disk
    IO operation becoming two different bios in the backend domain, the
    checks in xen_biovec_phys_mergeable will succeed, because bfn1 == bfn2
    (they both point to the same mfn). However due to the bio merging,
    the backend domain will end up with a bio that expands past mfn A into
    mfn A + 1.
    
    Fix this by making sure the check in xen_biovec_phys_mergeable takes
    into account the offset and the length of the bio, this basically
    replicates whats done in __BIOVEC_PHYS_MERGEABLE using mfns (bus
    addresses). While there also remove the usage of
    __BIOVEC_PHYS_MERGEABLE, since that's already checked by the callers
    of xen_biovec_phys_mergeable.

    KEYS: prevent KEYCTL_READ on negative key
    
    Because keyctl_read_key() looks up the key with no permissions
    requested, it may find a negatively instantiated key.  If the key is
    also possessed, we went ahead and called ->read() on the key.  But the
    key payload will actually contain the ->reject_error rather than the
    normal payload.  Thus, the kernel oopses trying to read the
    user_key_payload from memory address (int)-ENOKEY = 0x00000000ffffff82.
    
    Fortunately the payload data is stored inline, so it shouldn't be
    possible to abuse this as an arbitrary memory read primitive...
    
    Reproducer:
        keyctl new_session
        keyctl request2 user desc '' @s
        keyctl read $(keyctl show | awk '/user: desc/ {print $1}')
    
    It causes a crash like the following:

    assoc_array: Fix a buggy node-splitting case
    
    This fixes CVE-2017-12193.
    
    Fix a case in the assoc_array implementation in which a new leaf is
    added that needs to go into a node that happens to be full, where the
    existing leaves in that node cluster together at that level to the
    exclusion of new leaf.
    
    What needs to happen is that the existing leaves get moved out to a new
    node, N1, at level + 1 and the existing node needs replacing with one,
    N0, that has pointers to the new leaf and to N1.
    
    The code that tries to do this gets this wrong in two ways:
    
     (1) The pointer that should've pointed from N0 to N1 is set to point
         recursively to N0 instead.
    
     (2) The backpointer from N0 needs to be set correctly in the case N0 is
         either the root node or reached through a shortcut.
    
    Fix this by removing this path and using the split_node path instead,
    which achieves the same end, but in a more general way (thanks to Eric
    Biggers for spotting the redundancy).
    
    The problem manifests itself as:
    
      BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000010

    A lock-unlock is missing in ASHMEM_SET_SIZE ioctl which can result in a
    race condition when mmap is called. After the !asma->file check, before
    setting asma->size, asma->file can be set in mmap. That would result in
    having different asma->size than the mapped memory size. Combined with
    ASHMEM_UNPIN ioctl and shrinker invocation, this can result in memory
    corruption.

    It means we vmalloc() a lot more memory than we had intended.  I believe
    that on 64 bit systems vmalloc() can succeed even if we ask it to
    allocate huge 4GB buffers.  So we would get memory corruption and likely
    a crash when we call ha->isp_ops->write_optrom() and ->read_optrom().
    
    Only root can trigger this bug.

    tcp: initialize rcv_mss to TCP_MIN_MSS instead of 0
    
    When tcp_disconnect() is called, inet_csk_delack_init() sets
    icsk->icsk_ack.rcv_mss to 0.
    This could potentially cause tcp_recvmsg() => tcp_cleanup_rbuf() =>
    __tcp_select_window() call path to have division by 0 issue.
    So this patch initializes rcv_mss to TCP_MIN_MSS instead of 0.

commit 197e7e521384a23b9e585178f3f11c9fa08274b9
Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>
Date:   Sun Aug 20 13:26:27 2017 -0700

    Sanitize 'move_pages()' permission checks
    
    The 'move_paghes()' system call was introduced long long ago with the
    same permission checks as for sending a signal (except using
    CAP_SYS_NICE instead of CAP_SYS_KILL for the overriding capability).
    
    That turns out to not be a great choice - while the system call really
    only moves physical page allocations around (and you need other
    capabilities to do a lot of it), you can check the return value to map
    out some the virtual address choices and defeat ASLR of a binary that
    still shares your uid.
    
    So change the access checks to the more common 'ptrace_may_access()'
    model instead.
    
    This tightens the access checks for the uid, and also effectively
    changes the CAP_SYS_NICE check to CAP_SYS_PTRACE, but it's unlikely that
    anybody really _uses_ this legacy system call any more (we hav ebetter
    NUMA placement models these days), so I expect nobody to notice.
    
    Famous last words.

    xfs: XFS_IS_REALTIME_INODE() should be false if no rt device present
    
    If using a kernel with CONFIG_XFS_RT=y and we set the RHINHERIT flag on
    a directory in a filesystem that does not have a realtime device and
    create a new file in that directory, it gets marked as a real time file.
    When data is written and a fsync is issued, the filesystem attempts to
    flush a non-existent rt device during the fsync process.
    
    This results in a crash dereferencing a null buftarg pointer in
    xfs_blkdev_issue_flush():
    
      BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000008
      IP: xfs_blkdev_issue_flush+0xd/0x20
      .....

    Setting RT inode flags does not require special privileges so any

    kernel is compiled with CONFIG_XFS_RT=y and run:
    
      # mkfs.xfs -f /dev/pmem0
      # mount /dev/pmem0 /mnt/test
      # mkdir /mnt/test/foo
      # xfs_io -c 'chattr +t' /mnt/test/foo
      # xfs_io -f -c 'pwrite 0 5m' -c fsync /mnt/test/foo/bar
    
    Or just run xfstests with MKFS_OPTIONS="-d rtinherit=1" and wait.
    
    Kernels built with CONFIG_XFS_RT=n are not exposed to this bug.

    usb: misc: legousbtower: Fix NULL pointer deference
    
    This patch fixes a NULL pointer dereference caused by a race codition in
    the probe function of the legousbtower driver. It re-structures the
    probe function to only register the interface after successfully reading
    the board's firmware ID.
    
    The probe function does not deregister the usb interface after an error
    receiving the devices firmware ID. The device file registered
    (/dev/usb/legousbtower%d) may be read/written globally before the probe
    function returns. When tower_delete is called in the probe function
    (after an r/w has been initiated), core dev structures are deleted while
    the file operation functions are still running. If the 0 address is
    mappable on the machine, this vulnerability can be used to create a
    Local Priviege Escalation exploit via a write-what-where condition by
    remapping dev->interrupt_out_buffer in tower_write. A forged USB device
    and local program execution would be required for LPE. The USB device
    would have to delay the control message in tower_probe and accept
    the control urb in tower_open whilst guest code initiated a write to the
    device file as tower_delete is called from the error in tower_probe.
    
    This bug has existed since 2003. Patch tested by emulated device.

    sctp: do not peel off an assoc from one netns to another one
    
    Now when peeling off an association to the sock in another netns, all
    transports in this assoc are not to be rehashed and keep use the old
    key in hashtable.
    
    As a transport uses sk->net as the hash key to insert into hashtable,
    it would miss removing these transports from hashtable due to the new
    netns when closing the sock and all transports are being freeed, then
    later an use-after-free issue could be caused when looking up an asoc
    and dereferencing those transports.
    
    This is a very old issue since very beginning, ChunYu found it with
    syzkaller fuzz testing with this series:
    
      socket$inet6_sctp()
      bind$inet6()
      sendto$inet6()
      unshare(0x40000000)
      getsockopt$inet_sctp6_SCTP_GET_ASSOC_ID_LIST()
      getsockopt$inet_sctp6_SCTP_SOCKOPT_PEELOFF()
    
    This patch is to block this call when peeling one assoc off from one
    netns to another one, so that the netns of all transport would not
    go out-sync with the key in hashtable.
    
    Note that this patch didn't fix it by rehashing transports, as it's
    difficult to handle the situation when the tuple is already in use
    in the new netns. Besides, no one would like to peel off one assoc
    to another netns, considering ipaddrs, ifaces, etc. are usually
    different.

    net: Fix double free and memory corruption in get_net_ns_by_id()
    
    (I can trivially verify that that idr_remove in cleanup_net happens
     after the network namespace count has dropped to zero --EWB)
    
    Function get_net_ns_by_id() does not check for net::count
    after it has found a peer in netns_ids idr.
    
    It may dereference a peer, after its count has already been
    finaly decremented. This leads to double free and memory
    corruption:
    
    put_net(peer)                                   rtnl_lock()

      |
      v
      cleanup_net()
        ...
        (Second free of peer)
    
    Also, put_net() on the right cpu may reorder with left's cpu
    list_replace_init(&cleanup_list, ..), and then cleanup_list
    will be corrupted.
    
    Since cleanup_net() is executed in worker thread, while
    put_net(peer) can happen everywhere, there should be
    enough time for concurrent get_net_ns_by_id() to pick
    the peer up, and the race does not seem to be unlikely.
    The patch fixes the problem in standard way.
    
    (Also, there is possible problem in peernet2id_alloc(), which requires
    check for net::count under nsid_lock and maybe_get_net(peer), but
    in current stable kernel it's used under rtnl_lock() and it has to be

    ALSA: seq: Fix use-after-free at creating a port
    
    There is a potential race window opened at creating and deleting a
    port via ioctl, as spotted by fuzzing.  snd_seq_create_port() creates
    a port object and returns its pointer, but it doesn't take the
    refcount, thus it can be deleted immediately by another thread.
    Meanwhile, snd_seq_ioctl_create_port() still calls the function
    snd_seq_system_client_ev_port_start() with the created port object
    that is being deleted, and this triggers use-after-free like:

    We may fix this in a few different ways, and in this patch, it's fixed
    simply by taking the refcount properly at snd_seq_create_port() and
    letting the caller unref the object after use.  Also, there is another
    potential use-after-free by sprintf() call in snd_seq_create_port(),
    and this is moved inside the lock.
    
    This fix covers CVE-2017-15265.

    KEYS: fix dereferencing NULL payload with nonzero length
    
    sys_add_key() and the KEYCTL_UPDATE operation of sys_keyctl() allowed a
    NULL payload with nonzero length to be passed to the key type's
    ->preparse(), ->instantiate(), and/or ->update() methods.  Various key
    types including asymmetric, cifs.idmap, cifs.spnego, and pkcs7_test did
    not handle this case, allowing an unprivileged user to trivially cause a
    NULL pointer dereference (kernel oops) if one of these key types was
    present.  Fix it by doing the copy_from_user() when 'plen' is nonzero
    rather than when '_payload' is non-NULL, causing the syscall to fail
    with EFAULT as expected when an invalid buffer is specified.

commit 60ff5b2f547af3828aebafd54daded44cfb0807a
Author: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>
Date:   Thu Oct 12 16:00:41 2017 +0100

    KEYS: don't let add_key() update an uninstantiated key
    
    Currently, when passed a key that already exists, add_key() will call the
    key's ->update() method if such exists.  But this is heavily broken in the
    case where the key is uninstantiated because it doesn't call
    __key_instantiate_and_link().  Consequently, it doesn't do most of the
    things that are supposed to happen when the key is instantiated, such as
    setting the instantiation state, clearing KEY_FLAG_USER_CONSTRUCT and
    awakening tasks waiting on it, and incrementing key->user->nikeys.
    
    It also never takes key_construction_mutex, which means that
    ->instantiate() can run concurrently with ->update() on the same key.  In
    the case of the "user" and "logon" key types this causes a memory leak, at
    best.  Maybe even worse, the ->update() methods of the "encrypted" and
    "trusted" key types actually just dereference a NULL pointer when passed an
    uninstantiated key.
    
    Change key_create_or_update() to wait interruptibly for the key to finish
    construction before continuing.
    
    This patch only affects *uninstantiated* keys.  For now we still allow a
    negatively instantiated key to be updated (thereby positively
    instantiating it), although that's broken too (the next patch fixes it)
    and I'm not sure that anyone actually uses that functionality either.
    
    Here is a simple reproducer for the bug using the "encrypted" key type
    (requires CONFIG_ENCRYPTED_KEYS=y), though as noted above the bug
    pertained to more than just the "encrypted" key type:
    
        #include <stdlib.h>
        #include <unistd.h>
        #include <keyutils.h>
    
        int main(void)
        {
            int ringid = keyctl_join_session_keyring(NULL);
    
            if (fork()) {
                for (;;) {
                    const char payload[] = "update user:foo 32";
    
                    usleep(rand() % 10000);
                    add_key("encrypted", "desc", payload, sizeof(payload), ringid);
                    keyctl_clear(ringid);
                }
            } else {
                for (;;)
                    request_key("encrypted", "desc", "callout_info", ringid);
            }
        }
    
    It causes:

commit 814fb7bb7db5433757d76f4c4502c96fc53b0b5e
Author: Eric Biggers <ebiggers@google.com>
Date:   Sat Sep 23 15:00:07 2017 +0200

    x86/fpu: Don't let userspace set bogus xcomp_bv
    
    On x86, userspace can use the ptrace() or rt_sigreturn() system calls to
    set a task's extended state (xstate) or "FPU" registers.  ptrace() can
    set them for another task using the PTRACE_SETREGSET request with
    NT_X86_XSTATE, while rt_sigreturn() can set them for the current task.
    In either case, registers can be set to any value, but the kernel
    assumes that the XSAVE area itself remains valid in the sense that the
    CPU can restore it.
    
    However, in the case where the kernel is using the uncompacted xstate
    format (which it does whenever the XSAVES instruction is unavailable),
    it was possible for userspace to set the xcomp_bv field in the
    xstate_header to an arbitrary value.  However, all bits in that field
    are reserved in the uncompacted case, so when switching to a task with
    nonzero xcomp_bv, the XRSTOR instruction failed with a #GP fault.  This
    caused the WARN_ON_FPU(err) in copy_kernel_to_xregs() to be hit.  In
    addition, since the error is otherwise ignored, the FPU registers from
    the task previously executing on the CPU were leaked.
    
    Fix the bug by checking that the user-supplied value of xcomp_bv is 0 in
    the uncompacted case, and returning an error otherwise.
    
    The reason for validating xcomp_bv rather than simply overwriting it
    with 0 is that we want userspace to see an error if it (incorrectly)
    provides an XSAVE area in compacted format rather than in uncompacted
    format.
    
    Note that as before, in case of error we clear the task's FPU state.
    This is perhaps non-ideal, especially for PTRACE_SETREGSET; it might be
    better to return an error before changing anything.  But it seems the
    "clear on error" behavior is fine for now, and it's a little tricky to
    do otherwise because it would mean we couldn't simply copy the full
    userspace state into kernel memory in one __copy_from_user().
    
    This bug was found by syzkaller, which hit the above-mentioned
    WARN_ON_FPU():

            return 1;
        }
    
    Note: the program only tests for the bug using the ptrace() system call.
    The bug can also be reproduced using the rt_sigreturn() system call, but
    only when called from a 32-bit program, since for 64-bit programs the
    kernel restores the FPU state from the signal frame by doing XRSTOR
    directly from userspace memory (with proper error checking).

commit 008ba2a13f2d04c947adc536d19debb8fe66f110
Author: Willem de Bruijn <willemb@google.com>
Date:   Thu Sep 14 17:14:41 2017 -0400

    packet: hold bind lock when rebinding to fanout hook
    
    Packet socket bind operations must hold the po->bind_lock. This keeps
    po->running consistent with whether the socket is actually on a ptype
    list to receive packets.
    
    fanout_add unbinds a socket and its packet_rcv/tpacket_rcv call, then
    binds the fanout object to receive through packet_rcv_fanout.
    
    Make it hold the po->bind_lock when testing po->running and rebinding.
    Else, it can race with other rebind operations, such as that in
    packet_set_ring from packet_rcv to tpacket_rcv. Concurrent updates
    can result in a socket being added to a fanout group twice, causing
    use-after-free KASAN bug reports, among others.
    
    Reported independently by both trinity and syzkaller.
    Verified that the syzkaller reproducer passes after this patch.

Date:   Tue Sep 26 12:19:37 2017 -0400

    packet: in packet_do_bind, test fanout with bind_lock held
    
    Once a socket has po->fanout set, it remains a member of the group
    until it is destroyed. The prot_hook must be constant and identical
    across sockets in the group.
    
    If fanout_add races with packet_do_bind between the test of po->fanout
    and taking the lock, the bind call may make type or dev inconsistent
    with that of the fanout group.
    
    Hold po->bind_lock when testing po->fanout to avoid this race.
    
    I had to introduce artificial delay (local_bh_enable) to actually
    observe the race.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 363b02dab09b3226f3bd1420dad9c72b79a42a76
Author: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>
Date:   Wed Oct 4 16:43:25 2017 +0100

    KEYS: Fix race between updating and finding a negative key
    
    Consolidate KEY_FLAG_INSTANTIATED, KEY_FLAG_NEGATIVE and the rejection
    error into one field such that:
    
     (1) The instantiation state can be modified/read atomically.
    
     (2) The error can be accessed atomically with the state.
    
     (3) The error isn't stored unioned with the payload pointers.
    
    This deals with the problem that the state is spread over three different
    objects (two bits and a separate variable) and reading or updating them
    atomically isn't practical, given that not only can uninstantiated keys
    change into instantiated or rejected keys, but rejected keys can also turn
    into instantiated keys - and someone accessing the key might not be using
    any locking.
    
    The main side effect of this problem is that what was held in the payload
    may change, depending on the state.  For instance, you might observe the
    key to be in the rejected state.  You then read the cached error, but if
    the key semaphore wasn't locked, the key might've become instantiated
    between the two reads - and you might now have something in hand that isn't
    actually an error code.
    
    The state is now KEY_IS_UNINSTANTIATED, KEY_IS_POSITIVE or a negative error
    code if the key is negatively instantiated.  The key_is_instantiated()
    function is replaced with key_is_positive() to avoid confusion as negative
    keys are also 'instantiated'.
    
    Additionally, barriering is included:
    
     (1) Order payload-set before state-set during instantiation.
    
     (2) Order state-read before payload-read when using the key.
    
    Further separate barriering is necessary if RCU is being used to access the
    payload content after reading the payload pointers.

    Also introduce a new flag, disconnected, to struct usb_mixer_interface
    for not performing the disconnection procedure twice.

    automatically, and it's performed in an off-load work.  This seems

    USB: uas: fix bug in handling of alternate settings
    
    The uas driver has a subtle bug in the way it handles alternate
    settings.  The uas_find_uas_alt_setting() routine returns an
    altsetting value (the bAlternateSetting number in the descriptor), but
    uas_use_uas_driver() then treats that value as an index to the
    intf->altsetting array, which it isn't.
    
    Normally this doesn't cause any problems because the various
    alternate settings have bAlternateSetting values 0, 1, 2, ..., so the
    value is equal to the index in the array.  But this is not guaranteed,
    and Andrey Konovalov used the syzkaller fuzzer with KASAN to get a
    slab-out-of-bounds error by violating this assumption.
    
    This patch fixes the bug by making uas_find_uas_alt_setting() return a
    pointer to the altsetting entry rather than either the value or the
    index.  Pointers are less subject to misinterpretation.

    USB: fix out-of-bounds in usb_set_configuration
    
    Andrey Konovalov reported a possible out-of-bounds problem for a USB interface
    association descriptor.  He writes:
    	It seems there's no proper size check of a USB_DT_INTERFACE_ASSOCIATION
    	descriptor. It's only checked that the size is >= 2 in
    	usb_parse_configuration(), so find_iad() might do out-of-bounds access
    	to intf_assoc->bInterfaceCount.
    
    And he's right, we don't check for crazy descriptors of this type very well, so
    resolve this problem.  Yet another issue found by syzkaller...

    usb: usbtest: fix NULL pointer dereference
    
    If the usbtest driver encounters a device with an IN bulk endpoint but
    no OUT bulk endpoint, it will try to dereference a NULL pointer
    (out->desc.bEndpointAddress).  The problem can be solved by adding a
    missing test.

    HID: usbhid: fix out-of-bounds bug
    
    The hid descriptor identifies the length and type of subordinate
    descriptors for a device. If the received hid descriptor is smaller than
    the size of the struct hid_descriptor, it is possible to cause
    out-of-bounds.
    
    In addition, if bNumDescriptors of the hid descriptor have an incorrect
    value, this can also cause out-of-bounds while approaching hdesc->desc[n].
    
    So check the size of hid descriptor and bNumDescriptors.

    USB: core: fix out-of-bounds access bug in usb_get_bos_descriptor()
    
    Andrey used the syzkaller fuzzer to find an out-of-bounds memory
    access in usb_get_bos_descriptor().  The code wasn't checking that the
    next usb_dev_cap_header structure could fit into the remaining buffer
    space.
    
    This patch fixes the error and also reduces the bNumDeviceCaps field
    in the header to match the actual number of capabilities found, in
    cases where there are fewer than expected.

    ipsec: Fix aborted xfrm policy dump crash
    
    An independent security researcher, Mohamed Ghannam, has reported
    this vulnerability to Beyond Security's SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure
    program.
    
    The xfrm_dump_policy_done function expects xfrm_dump_policy to
    have been called at least once or it will crash.  This can be
    triggered if a dump fails because the target socket's receive
    buffer is full.
    
    This patch fixes it by using the cb->start mechanism to ensure that
    the initialisation is always done regardless of the buffer situation.

    mm/pagewalk.c: report holes in hugetlb ranges
    
    This matters at least for the mincore syscall, which will otherwise copy
    uninitialized memory from the page allocator to userspace.  It is
    probably also a correctness error for /proc/$pid/pagemap, but I haven't
    tested that.
    
    Removing the `walk->hugetlb_entry` condition in walk_hugetlb_range() has
    no effect because the caller already checks for that.
    
    This only reports holes in hugetlb ranges to callers who have specified
    a hugetlb_entry callback.
    
    This issue was found using an AFL-based fuzzer.

    USB: core: prevent malicious bNumInterfaces overflow
    
    A malicious USB device with crafted descriptors can cause the kernel
    to access unallocated memory by setting the bNumInterfaces value too
    high in a configuration descriptor.  Although the value is adjusted
    during parsing, this adjustment is skipped in one of the error return
    paths.
    
    This patch prevents the problem by setting bNumInterfaces to 0
    initially.  The existing code already sets it to the proper value
    after parsing is complete.

    The path of patched vmmcall will patch 3 bytes opcode 0F 01 C1(vmcall)
    to the guest memory, however, write_mmio tracepoint always prints 8 bytes
    through *(u64 *)val since kvm splits the mmio access into 8 bytes. This
    leaks 5 bytes from the kernel stack (CVE-2017-17741).  This patch fixes
    it by just accessing the bytes which we operate on.

    because walk->buffer and walk->page have not been initialized.
    
    The bug is that Salsa20 is calling blkcipher_walk_done() even when
    nothing is in 'walk.nbytes'.  But blkcipher_walk_done() is only meant to
    be called when a nonzero number of bytes have been provided.
    
    The broken code is part of an optimization that tries to make only one
    call to salsa20_encrypt_bytes() to process inputs that are not evenly
    divisible by 64 bytes.  To fix the bug, just remove this "optimization"
    and use the blkcipher_walk API the same way all the other users do.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit af3ff8045bbf3e32f1a448542e73abb4c8ceb6f1
Author: Eric Biggers <ebiggers@google.com>
Date:   Tue Nov 28 18:01:38 2017 -0800

    crypto: hmac - require that the underlying hash algorithm is unkeyed
    
    Because the HMAC template didn't check that its underlying hash
    algorithm is unkeyed, trying to use "hmac(hmac(sha3-512-generic))"
    through AF_ALG or through KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE resulted in the inner HMAC
    being used without having been keyed, resulting in sha3_update() being
    called without sha3_init(), causing a stack buffer overflow.
    
    This is a very old bug, but it seems to have only started causing real
    problems when SHA-3 support was added (requires CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA3)
    because the innermost hash's state is ->import()ed from a zeroed buffer,
    and it just so happens that other hash algorithms are fine with that,
    but SHA-3 is not.  However, there could be arch or hardware-dependent
    hash algorithms also affected; I couldn't test everything.
    
    Fix the bug by introducing a function crypto_shash_alg_has_setkey()
    which tests whether a shash algorithm is keyed.  Then update the HMAC
    template to require that its underlying hash algorithm is unkeyed.
    
    Here is a reproducer:
    
        #include <linux/if_alg.h>
        #include <sys/socket.h>
    
        int main()
        {
            int algfd;
            struct sockaddr_alg addr = {
                .salg_type = "hash",
                .salg_name = "hmac(hmac(sha3-512-generic))",
            };
            char key[4096] = { 0 };
    
            algfd = socket(AF_ALG, SOCK_SEQPACKET, 0);
            bind(algfd, (const struct sockaddr *)&addr, sizeof(addr));
            setsockopt(algfd, SOL_ALG, ALG_SET_KEY, key, sizeof(key));
        }

commit 4dca6ea1d9432052afb06baf2e3ae78188a4410b
Author: Eric Biggers <ebiggers@google.com>
Date:   Fri Dec 8 15:13:27 2017 +0000

    KEYS: add missing permission check for request_key() destination
    
    When the request_key() syscall is not passed a destination keyring, it
    links the requested key (if constructed) into the "default" request-key
    keyring.  This should require Write permission to the keyring.  However,
    there is actually no permission check.
    
    This can be abused to add keys to any keyring to which only Search
    permission is granted.  This is because Search permission allows joining
    the keyring.  keyctl_set_reqkey_keyring(KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_SESSION_KEYRING)
    then will set the default request-key keyring to the session keyring.
    Then, request_key() can be used to add keys to the keyring.
    
    Both negatively and positively instantiated keys can be added using this
    method.  Adding negative keys is trivial.  Adding a positive key is a
    bit trickier.  It requires that either /sbin/request-key positively
    instantiates the key, or that another thread adds the key to the process
    keyring at just the right time, such that request_key() misses it
    initially but then finds it in construct_alloc_key().
    
    Fix this bug by checking for Write permission to the keyring in
    construct_get_dest_keyring() when the default keyring is being used.
    
    We don't do the permission check for non-default keyrings because that
    was already done by the earlier call to lookup_user_key().  Also,
    request_key_and_link() is currently passed a 'struct key *' rather than
    a key_ref_t, so the "possessed" bit is unavailable.
    
    We also don't do the permission check for the "requestor keyring", to
    continue to support the use case described by commit 8bbf4976b59f
    ("KEYS: Alter use of key instantiation link-to-keyring argument") where
    /sbin/request-key recursively calls request_key() to add keys to the
    original requestor's destination keyring.  (I don't know of any users
    who actually do that, though...)

    KVM: x86: fix emulation of "MOV SS, null selector"
    
    This is CVE-2017-2583.  On Intel this causes a failed vmentry because
    SS's type is neither 3 nor 7 (even though the manual says this check is
    only done for usable SS, and the dmesg splat says that SS is unusable!).
    On AMD it's worse: svm.c is confused and sets CPL to 0 in the vmcb.
    
    The fix fabricates a data segment descriptor when SS is set to a null
    selector, so that CPL and SS.DPL are set correctly in the VMCS/vmcb.
    Furthermore, only allow setting SS to a NULL selector if SS.RPL < 3;
    this in turn ensures CPL < 3 because RPL must be equal to CPL.
    
    Thanks to Andy Lutomirski and Willy Tarreau for help in analyzing
    the bug and deciphering the manuals.

    selinux: fix off-by-one in setprocattr
    
    SELinux tries to support setting/clearing of /proc/pid/attr attributes
    from the shell by ignoring terminating newlines and treating an
    attribute value that begins with a NUL or newline as an attempt to
    clear the attribute.  However, the test for clearing attributes has
    always been wrong; it has an off-by-one error, and this could further
    lead to reading past the end of the allocated buffer since commit
    bb646cdb12e75d82258c2f2e7746d5952d3e321a ("proc_pid_attr_write():
    switch to memdup_user()").  Fix the off-by-one error.
    
    Even with this fix, setting and clearing /proc/pid/attr attributes
    from the shell is not straightforward since the interface does not
    support multiple write() calls (so shells that write the value and
    newline separately will set and then immediately clear the attribute,
    requiring use of echo -n to set the attribute), whereas trying to use
    echo -n "" to clear the attribute causes the shell to skip the
    write() call altogether since POSIX says that a zero-length write
    causes no side effects. Thus, one must use echo -n to set and echo
    without -n to clear, as in the following example:
    $ echo -n unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 > /proc/$$/attr/fscreate
    $ cat /proc/$$/attr/fscreate
    unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0
    $ echo "" > /proc/$$/attr/fscreate
    $ cat /proc/$$/attr/fscreate
    
    Note the use of /proc/$$ rather than /proc/self, as otherwise
    the cat command will read its own attribute value, not that of the shell.
    
    There are no users of this facility to my knowledge; possibly we
    should just get rid of it.
    
    UPDATE: Upon further investigation it appears that a local process
    with the process:setfscreate permission can cause a kernel panic as a
    result of this bug.  This patch fixes CVE-2017-2618.

    tty: n_hdlc: get rid of racy n_hdlc.tbuf
    
    Currently N_HDLC line discipline uses a self-made singly linked list for
    data buffers and has n_hdlc.tbuf pointer for buffer retransmitting after
    an error.
    
    The commit be10eb7589337e5defbe214dae038a53dd21add8
    ("tty: n_hdlc add buffer flushing") introduced racy access to n_hdlc.tbuf.
    After tx error concurrent flush_tx_queue() and n_hdlc_send_frames() can put
    one data buffer to tx_free_buf_list twice. That causes double free in
    n_hdlc_release().
    
    Let's use standard kernel linked list and get rid of n_hdlc.tbuf:
    in case of tx error put current data buffer after the head of tx_buf_list.

    this is no longer supported on x86 with VMAP_STACK either.
    
    Note that the macro-mode buffer was larger than necessary.

    ieee802154: atusb: do not use the stack for buffers to make them DMA able
    
    From 4.9 we should really avoid using the stack here as this will not be DMA
    able on various platforms. This changes the buffers already being present in
    time of 4.9 being released. This should go into stable as well.

    ipc/shm: Fix shmat mmap nil-page protection
    
    The issue is described here, with a nice testcase:
    
        https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=192931
    
    The problem is that shmat() calls do_mmap_pgoff() with MAP_FIXED, and
    the address rounded down to 0.  For the regular mmap case, the
    protection mentioned above is that the kernel gets to generate the
    address -- arch_get_unmapped_area() will always check for MAP_FIXED and
    return that address.  So by the time we do security_mmap_addr(0) things
    get funky for shmat().
    
    The testcase itself shows that while a regular user crashes, root will
    not have a problem attaching a nil-page.  There are two possible fixes
    to this.  The first, and which this patch does, is to simply allow root
    to crash as well -- this is also regular mmap behavior, ie when hacking
    up the testcase and adding mmap(...  |MAP_FIXED).  While this approach
    is the safer option, the second alternative is to ignore SHM_RND if the
    rounded address is 0, thus only having MAP_SHARED flags.  This makes the
    behavior of shmat() identical to the mmap() case.  The downside of this
    is obviously user visible, but does make sense in that it maintains
    semantics after the round-down wrt 0 address and mmap.
    
    Passes shm related ltp tests.

    perf/core: Fix concurrent sys_perf_event_open() vs. 'move_group' race
    
    Di Shen reported a race between two concurrent sys_perf_event_open()
    calls where both try and move the same pre-existing software group
    into a hardware context.
    
    The problem is exactly that described in commit:
    
      f63a8daa5812 ("perf: Fix event->ctx locking")
    
    ... where, while we wait for a ctx->mutex acquisition, the event->ctx
    relation can have changed under us.
    
    That very same commit failed to recognise sys_perf_event_context() as an
    external access vector to the events and thereby didn't apply the
    established locking rules correctly.
    
    So while one sys_perf_event_open() call is stuck waiting on
    mutex_lock_double(), the other (which owns said locks) moves the group
    about. So by the time the former sys_perf_event_open() acquires the
    locks, the context we've acquired is stale (and possibly dead).
    
    Apply the established locking rules as per perf_event_ctx_lock_nested()
    to the mutex_lock_double() for the 'move_group' case. This obviously means
    we need to validate state after we acquire the locks.

    dccp: fix freeing skb too early for IPV6_RECVPKTINFO
    
    In the current DCCP implementation an skb for a DCCP_PKT_REQUEST packet
    is forcibly freed via __kfree_skb in dccp_rcv_state_process if
    dccp_v6_conn_request successfully returns.
    
    However, if IPV6_RECVPKTINFO is set on a socket, the address of the skb
    is saved to ireq->pktopts and the ref count for skb is incremented in
    dccp_v6_conn_request, so skb is still in use. Nevertheless, it gets freed
    in dccp_rcv_state_process.
    
    Fix by calling consume_skb instead of doing goto discard and therefore
    calling __kfree_skb.
    
    Similar fixes for TCP:

    __tcp_splice_read() returns 0, and sk_wait_data() immediately
    returns since there is the problematic skb in queue.

    sctp: deny peeloff operation on asocs with threads sleeping on it
    
    commit 2dcab5984841 ("sctp: avoid BUG_ON on sctp_wait_for_sndbuf")
    attempted to avoid a BUG_ON call when the association being used for a
    sendmsg() is blocked waiting for more sndbuf and another thread did a
    peeloff operation on such asoc, moving it to another socket.
    
    As Ben Hutchings noticed, then in such case it would return without
    locking back the socket and would cause two unlocks in a row.
    
    Further analysis also revealed that it could allow a double free if the
    application managed to peeloff the asoc that is created during the
    sendmsg call, because then sctp_sendmsg() would try to free the asoc
    that was created only for that call.
    
    This patch takes another approach. It will deny the peeloff operation
    if there is a thread sleeping on the asoc, so this situation doesn't
    exist anymore. This avoids the issues described above and also honors
    the syscalls that are already being handled (it can be multiple sendmsg
    calls).
    
    Joint work with Xin Long.

    xfrm_user: validate XFRM_MSG_NEWAE XFRMA_REPLAY_ESN_VAL replay_window
    
    When a new xfrm state is created during an XFRM_MSG_NEWSA call we
    validate the user supplied replay_esn to ensure that the size is valid
    and to ensure that the replay_window size is within the allocated
    buffer.  However later it is possible to update this replay_esn via a
    XFRM_MSG_NEWAE call.  There we again validate the size of the supplied
    buffer matches the existing state and if so inject the contents.  We do
    not at this point check that the replay_window is within the allocated
    memory.  This leads to out-of-bounds reads and writes triggered by
    netlink packets.  This leads to memory corruption and the potential for
    priviledge escalation.
    
    We already attempt to validate the incoming replay information in
    xfrm_new_ae() via xfrm_replay_verify_len().  This confirms that the user
    is not trying to change the size of the replay state buffer which
    includes the replay_esn.  It however does not check the replay_window
    remains within that buffer.  Add validation of the contained
    replay_window.

    drm/vmwgfx: fix integer overflow in vmw_surface_define_ioctl()
    
    In vmw_surface_define_ioctl(), the 'num_sizes' is the sum of the
    'req->mip_levels' array. This array can be assigned any value from
    the user space. As both the 'num_sizes' and the array is uint32_t,
    it is easy to make 'num_sizes' overflow. The later 'mip_levels' is
    used as the loop count. This can lead an oob write. Add the check of
    'req->mip_levels' to avoid this.

    fscrypt: remove broken support for detecting keyring key revocation
    
    Filesystem encryption ostensibly supported revoking a keyring key that
    had been used to "unlock" encrypted files, causing those files to become
    "locked" again.  This was, however, buggy for several reasons, the most
    severe of which was that when key revocation happened to be detected for
    an inode, its fscrypt_info was immediately freed, even while other
    threads could be using it for encryption or decryption concurrently.
    This could be exploited to crash the kernel or worse.
    
    This patch fixes the use-after-free by removing the code which detects
    the keyring key having been revoked, invalidated, or expired.  Instead,
    an encrypted inode that is "unlocked" now simply remains unlocked until
    it is evicted from memory.  Note that this is no worse than the case for
    block device-level encryption, e.g. dm-crypt, and it still remains
    possible for a privileged user to evict unused pages, inodes, and
    dentries by running 'sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches', or by
    simply unmounting the filesystem.  In fact, one of those actions was
    already needed anyway for key revocation to work even somewhat sanely.
    This change is not expected to break any applications.
    
    In the future I'd like to implement a real API for fscrypt key
    revocation that interacts sanely with ongoing filesystem operations ---
    waiting for existing operations to complete and blocking new operations,
    and invalidating and sanitizing key material and plaintext from the VFS
    caches.  But this is a hard problem, and for now this bug must be fixed.
    
    This bug affected almost all versions of ext4, f2fs, and ubifs
    encryption, and it was potentially reachable in any kernel configured
    with encryption support (CONFIG_EXT4_ENCRYPTION=y,
    CONFIG_EXT4_FS_ENCRYPTION=y, CONFIG_F2FS_FS_ENCRYPTION=y, or
    CONFIG_UBIFS_FS_ENCRYPTION=y).  Note that older kernels did not use the
    shared fs/crypto/ code, but due to the potential security implications
    of this bug, it may still be worthwhile to backport this fix to them.

    Fix it by only creating a new thread keyring if there wasn't one before.
    To make things more consistent, make install_thread_keyring_to_cred()
    and install_process_keyring_to_cred() both return 0 if the corresponding
    keyring is already present.

    rxrpc: Fix several cases where a padded len isn't checked in ticket decode
    
    This fixes CVE-2017-7482.
    
    When a kerberos 5 ticket is being decoded so that it can be loaded into an
    rxrpc-type key, there are several places in which the length of a
    variable-length field is checked to make sure that it's not going to
    overrun the available data - but the data is padded to the nearest
    four-byte boundary and the code doesn't check for this extra.  This could
    lead to the size-remaining variable wrapping and the data pointer going
    over the end of the buffer.
    
    Fix this by making the various variable-length data checks use the padded
    length.

    ext4: fix data exposure after a crash
    
    Huang has reported that in his powerfail testing he is seeing stale
    block contents in some of recently allocated blocks although he mounts
    ext4 in data=ordered mode. After some investigation I have found out
    that indeed when delayed allocation is used, we don't add inode to
    transaction's list of inodes needing flushing before commit. Originally
    we were doing that but commit f3b59291a69d removed the logic with a
    flawed argument that it is not needed.
    
    The problem is that although for delayed allocated blocks we write their
    contents immediately after allocating them, there is no guarantee that
    the IO scheduler or device doesn't reorder things and thus transaction
    allocating blocks and attaching them to inode can reach stable storage
    before actual block contents. Actually whenever we attach freshly
    allocated blocks to inode using a written extent, we should add inode to
    transaction's ordered inode list to make sure we properly wait for block
    contents to be written before committing the transaction. So that is
    what we do in this patch. This also handles other cases where stale data
    exposure was possible - like filling hole via mmap in
    data=ordered,nodelalloc mode.
    
    The only exception to the above rule are extending direct IO writes where
    blkdev_direct_IO() waits for IO to complete before increasing i_size and
    thus stale data exposure is not possible. For now we don't complicate
    the code with optimizing this special case since the overhead is pretty
    low. In case this is observed to be a performance problem we can always
    handle it using a special flag to ext4_map_blocks().

    KVM: x86: fix singlestepping over syscall
    
    TF is handled a bit differently for syscall and sysret, compared
    to the other instructions: TF is checked after the instruction completes,
    so that the OS can disable #DB at a syscall by adding TF to FMASK.
    When the sysret is executed the #DB is taken "as if" the syscall insn

    KVM emulates syscall so that it can trap 32-bit syscall on Intel processors.
    Fix the behavior, otherwise you could get #DB on a user stack which is not
    nice.  This does not affect Linux guests, as they use an IST or task gate
    for #DB.
    
    This fixes CVE-2017-7518.

    dentry name snapshots
    
    take_dentry_name_snapshot() takes a safe snapshot of dentry name;
    if the name is a short one, it gets copied into caller-supplied
    structure, otherwise an extra reference to external name is grabbed
    (those are never modified).  In either case the pointer to stable
    string is stored into the same structure.
    
    dentry must be held by the caller of take_dentry_name_snapshot(),
    but may be freely dropped afterwards - the snapshot will stay
    until destroyed by release_dentry_name_snapshot().
    
    Intended use:
    	struct name_snapshot s;
    
    	take_dentry_name_snapshot(&s, dentry);
    	...
    	access s.name
    	...
    	release_dentry_name_snapshot(&s);
    
    Replaces fsnotify_oldname_...(), gets used in fsnotify to obtain the name
    to pass down with event.

    brcmfmac: fix possible buffer overflow in brcmf_cfg80211_mgmt_tx()
    
    The lower level nl80211 code in cfg80211 ensures that "len" is between
    25 and NL80211_ATTR_FRAME (2304).  We subtract DOT11_MGMT_HDR_LEN (24) from
    "len" so thats's max of 2280.  However, the action_frame->data[] buffer is
    only BRCMF_FIL_ACTION_FRAME_SIZE (1800) bytes long so this memcpy() can
    overflow.
    
    	memcpy(action_frame->data, &buf[DOT11_MGMT_HDR_LEN],
    	       le16_to_cpu(action_frame->len));

    In some cases, offset can overflow and can cause an infinite loop in

    cap it at IPV6_MAXPLEN, since packets larger than that should be invalid.

    crypto: ahash - Fix EINPROGRESS notification callback
    
    The ahash API modifies the request's callback function in order
    to clean up after itself in some corner cases (unaligned final
    and missing finup).
    
    When the request is complete ahash will restore the original
    callback and everything is fine.  However, when the request gets
    an EBUSY on a full queue, an EINPROGRESS callback is made while
    the request is still ongoing.
    
    In this case the ahash API will incorrectly call its own callback.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by creating a temporary request
    object on the stack which is used to relay EINPROGRESS back to
    the original completion function.
    
    This patch also adds code to preserve the original flags value.

    The NFSv2/v3 code does not systematically check whether we decode past

    are a few places where we do arithmetic on the pointers involved and
    don't account for the possibility that a length could be negative.  Add

    nfsd: check for oversized NFSv2/v3 arguments
    
    A client can append random data to the end of an NFSv2 or NFSv3 RPC call
    without our complaining; we'll just stop parsing at the end of the
    expected data and ignore the rest.
    
    Encoded arguments and replies are stored together in an array of pages,
    and if a call is too large it could leave inadequate space for the
    reply.  This is normally OK because NFS RPC's typically have either
    short arguments and long replies (like READ) or long arguments and short
    replies (like WRITE).  But a client that sends an incorrectly long reply
    can violate those assumptions.  This was observed to cause crashes.
    
    Also, several operations increment rq_next_page in the decode routine
    before checking the argument size, which can leave rq_next_page pointing
    well past the end of the page array, causing trouble later in
    svc_free_pages.
    
    So, following a suggestion from Neil Brown, add a central check to
    enforce our expectation that no NFSv2/v3 call has both a large call and
    a large reply.
    
    As followup we may also want to rewrite the encoding routines to check
    more carefully that they aren't running off the end of the page array.
    
    We may also consider rejecting calls that have any extra garbage
    appended.  That would be safer, and within our rights by spec, but given
    the age of our server and the NFS protocol, and the fact that we've
    never enforced this before, we may need to balance that against the
    possibility of breaking some oddball client.

    mm: Tighten x86 /dev/mem with zeroing reads
    
    Under CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM, reading System RAM through /dev/mem is
    disallowed. However, on x86, the first 1MB was always allowed for BIOS
    and similar things, regardless of it actually being System RAM. It was
    possible for heap to end up getting allocated in low 1MB RAM, and then
    read by things like x86info or dd, which would trip hardened usercopy:
    
    usercopy: kernel memory exposure attempt detected from ffff880000090000 (dma-kmalloc-256) (4096 bytes)
    
    This changes the x86 exception for the low 1MB by reading back zeros for
    System RAM areas instead of blindly allowing them. More work is needed to
    extend this to mmap, but currently mmap doesn't go through usercopy, so
    hardened usercopy won't Oops the kernel.

    [media] dvb-usb-v2: avoid use-after-free
    
    I ran into a stack frame size warning because of the on-stack copy of
    the USB device structure:
    
    drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb-v2/dvb_usb_core.c: In function 'dvb_usbv2_disconnect':
    drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb-v2/dvb_usb_core.c:1029:1: error: the frame size of 1104 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]
    
    Copying a device structure like this is wrong for a number of other reasons
    too aside from the possible stack overflow. One of them is that the
    dev_info() call will print the name of the device later, but AFAICT
    we have only copied a pointer to the name earlier and the actual name
    has been freed by the time it gets printed.
    
    This removes the on-stack copy of the device and instead copies the
    device name using kstrdup(). I'm ignoring the possible failure here
    as both printk() and kfree() are able to deal with NULL pointers.

    nfsd: encoders mustn't use unitialized values in error cases
    
    In error cases, lgp->lg_layout_type may be out of bounds; so we
    shouldn't be using it until after the check of nfserr.
    
    This was seen to crash nfsd threads when the server receives a LAYOUTGET
    request with a large layout type.
    
    GETDEVICEINFO has the same problem.

    dccp/tcp: do not inherit mc_list from parent
    
    syzkaller found a way to trigger double frees from ip_mc_drop_socket()
    
    It turns out that leave a copy of parent mc_list at accept() time,
    which is very bad.
    
    Very similar to commit 8b485ce69876 ("tcp: do not inherit
    fastopen_req from parent")
    
    Initial report from Pray3r, completed by Andrey one.

    USB: serial: omninet: fix reference leaks at open
    
    This driver needlessly took another reference to the tty on open, a
    reference which was then never released on close. This lead to not just
    a leak of the tty, but also a driver reference leak that prevented the
    driver from being unloaded after a port had once been opened.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 2423496af35d94a87156b063ea5cedffc10a70a1
Author: Craig Gallek <kraig@google.com>

    ipv6: Prevent overrun when parsing v6 header options
    
    The KASAN warning repoted below was discovered with a syzkaller
    program.  The reproducer is basically:
      int s = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_RAW, NEXTHDR_HOP);
      send(s, &one_byte_of_data, 1, MSG_MORE);
      send(s, &more_than_mtu_bytes_data, 2000, 0);
    
    The socket() call sets the nexthdr field of the v6 header to
    NEXTHDR_HOP, the first send call primes the payload with a non zero
    byte of data, and the second send call triggers the fragmentation path.
    
    The fragmentation code tries to parse the header options in order
    to figure out where to insert the fragment option.  Since nexthdr points
    to an invalid option, the calculation of the size of the network header
    can made to be much larger than the linear section of the skb and data
    is read outside of it.
    
    This fix makes ip6_find_1stfrag return an error if it detects
    running out-of-bounds.

    ipv6/dccp: do not inherit ipv6_mc_list from parent
    
    Like commit 657831ffc38e ("dccp/tcp: do not inherit mc_list from parent")
    we should clear ipv6_mc_list etc. for IPv6 sockets too.

    bpf: don't let ldimm64 leak map addresses on unprivileged
    
    The patch fixes two things at once:
    
    1) It checks the env->allow_ptr_leaks and only prints the map address to
       the log if we have the privileges to do so, otherwise it just dumps 0
       as we would when kptr_restrict is enabled on %pK. Given the latter is
       off by default and not every distro sets it, I don't want to rely on
       this, hence the 0 by default for unprivileged.
    
    2) Printing of ldimm64 in the verifier log is currently broken in that
       we don't print the full immediate, but only the 32 bit part of the
       first insn part for ldimm64. Thus, fix this up as well; it's okay to
       access, since we verified all ldimm64 earlier already (including just
       constants) through replace_map_fd_with_map_ptr().
    
    Fixes: 1be7f75d1668 ("bpf: enable non-root eBPF programs")
    Fixes: cbd357008604 ("bpf: verifier (add ability to receive verification log)")

    ipv6: fix out of bound writes in __ip6_append_data()
    
    Andrey Konovalov and idaifish@gmail.com reported crashes caused by
    one skb shared_info being overwritten from __ip6_append_data()
    
    Andrey program lead to following state :
    
    copy -4200 datalen 2000 fraglen 2040
    maxfraglen 2040 alloclen 2048 transhdrlen 0 offset 0 fraggap 6200
    
    The skb_copy_and_csum_bits(skb_prev, maxfraglen, data + transhdrlen,
    fraggap, 0); is overwriting skb->head and skb_shared_info
    
    Since we apparently detect this rare condition too late, move the
    code earlier to even avoid allocating skb and risking crashes.
    
    Once again, many thanks to Andrey and syzkaller team.

    drm/vmwgfx: Make sure backup_handle is always valid
    
    When vmw_gb_surface_define_ioctl() is called with an existing buffer,
    we end up returning an uninitialized variable in the backup_handle.
    
    The fix is to first initialize backup_handle to 0 just to be sure, and
    second, when a user-provided buffer is found, we will use the
    req->buffer_handle as the backup_handle.

    The ISA msnd drivers have loops fetching the ring-buffer head, tail

    This patch optimizes it, and also adds the sanity check to avoid the

    When args->nr_local is 0, nr_pages gets also 0 due some size
    calculation via rds_rm_size(), which is later used to allocate
    pages for DMA, this bug produces a heap Out-Of-Bound write access
    to a specific memory region.
