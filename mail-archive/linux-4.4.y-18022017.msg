    ip6_gre: fix ip6gre_err() invalid reads
    
    Andrey Konovalov reported out of bound accesses in ip6gre_err()
    
    If GRE flags contains GRE_KEY, the following expression
    *(((__be32 *)p) + (grehlen / 4) - 1)
    
    accesses data ~40 bytes after the expected point, since
    grehlen includes the size of IPv6 headers.
    
    Let's use a "struct gre_base_hdr *greh" pointer to make this
    code more readable.
    
    p[1] becomes greh->protocol.
    grhlen is the GRE header length.

    ipv4: keep skb->dst around in presence of IP options
    
    Andrey Konovalov got crashes in __ip_options_echo() when a NULL skb->dst
    is accessed.
    
    ipv4_pktinfo_prepare() should not drop the dst if (evil) IP options
    are present.
    
    We could refine the test to the presence of ts_needtime or srr,
    but IP options are not often used, so let's be conservative.
    
    Thanks to syzkaller team for finding this bug.

    sctp: avoid BUG_ON on sctp_wait_for_sndbuf
    
    Alexander Popov reported that an application may trigger a BUG_ON in
    sctp_wait_for_sndbuf if the socket tx buffer is full, a thread is
    waiting on it to queue more data and meanwhile another thread peels off
    the association being used by the first thread.
    
    This patch replaces the BUG_ON call with a proper error handling. It
    will return -EPIPE to the original sendmsg call, similarly to what would
    have been done if the association wasn't found in the first place.
