    vhost: validate vhost_get_vq_desc return value
    
    vhost fails to validate negative error code
    from vhost_get_vq_desc causing
    a crash: we are using -EFAULT which is 0xfffffff2
    as vector size, which exceeds the allocated size.
    
    The code in question was introduced in commit
    8dd014adfea6f173c1ef6378f7e5e7924866c923
        vhost-net: mergeable buffers support

    skbuff: skb_segment: orphan frags before copying
    
    skb_segment copies frags around, so we need
    to copy them carefully to avoid accessing
    user memory after reporting completion to userspace
    through a callback.
    
    skb_segment doesn't normally happen on datapath:
    TSO needs to be disabled - so disabling zero copy
    in this case does not look like a big deal.
