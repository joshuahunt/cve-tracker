    mm, oom: fix concurrent munlock and oom reaper unmap, v3
    
    Since exit_mmap() is done without the protection of mm->mmap_sem, it is
    possible for the oom reaper to concurrently operate on an mm until
    MMF_OOM_SKIP is set.
    
    This allows munlock_vma_pages_all() to concurrently run while the oom
    reaper is operating on a vma.  Since munlock_vma_pages_range() depends
    on clearing VM_LOCKED from vm_flags before actually doing the munlock to
    determine if any other vmas are locking the same memory, the check for
    VM_LOCKED in the oom reaper is racy.
    
    This is especially noticeable on architectures such as powerpc where
    clearing a huge pmd requires serialize_against_pte_lookup().  If the pmd
    is zapped by the oom reaper during follow_page_mask() after the check
    for pmd_none() is bypassed, this ends up deferencing a NULL ptl or a
    kernel oops.
    
    Fix this by manually freeing all possible memory from the mm before
    doing the munlock and then setting MMF_OOM_SKIP.  The oom reaper can not
    run on the mm anymore so the munlock is safe to do in exit_mmap().  It
    also matches the logic that the oom reaper currently uses for
    determining when to set MMF_OOM_SKIP itself, so there's no new risk of
    excessive oom killing.
    
    This issue fixes CVE-2018-1000200.
