Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 1be7107fbe18eed3e319a6c3e83c78254b693acb
Author: Hugh Dickins <hughd@google.com>

    mm: larger stack guard gap, between vmas
    
    Stack guard page is a useful feature to reduce a risk of stack smashing
    into a different mapping. We have been using a single page gap which
    is sufficient to prevent having stack adjacent to a different mapping.
    But this seems to be insufficient in the light of the stack usage in
    userspace. E.g. glibc uses as large as 64kB alloca() in many commonly
    used functions. Others use constructs liks gid_t buffer[NGROUPS_MAX]
    which is 256kB or stack strings with MAX_ARG_STRLEN.
    
    This will become especially dangerous for suid binaries and the default
    no limit for the stack size limit because those applications can be
    tricked to consume a large portion of the stack and a single glibc call
    could jump over the guard page. These attacks are not theoretical,
    unfortunatelly.
    
    Make those attacks less probable by increasing the stack guard gap
    to 1MB (on systems with 4k pages; but make it depend on the page size
    because systems with larger base pages might cap stack allocations in
    the PAGE_SIZE units) which should cover larger alloca() and VLA stack
    allocations. It is obviously not a full fix because the problem is
    somehow inherent, but it should reduce attack space a lot.
    
    One could argue that the gap size should be configurable from userspace,
    but that can be done later when somebody finds that the new 1MB is wrong
    for some special case applications.  For now, add a kernel command line
    option (stack_guard_gap) to specify the stack gap size (in page units).
    
    Implementation wise, first delete all the old code for stack guard page:
    because although we could get away with accounting one extra page in a
    stack vma, accounting a larger gap can break userspace - case in point,
    a program run with "ulimit -S -v 20000" failed when the 1MB gap was
    counted for RLIMIT_AS; similar problems could come with RLIMIT_MLOCK
    and strict non-overcommit mode.
    
    Instead of keeping gap inside the stack vma, maintain the stack guard
    gap as a gap between vmas: using vm_start_gap() in place of vm_start
    (or vm_end_gap() in place of vm_end if VM_GROWSUP) in just those few
    places which need to respect the gap - mainly arch_get_unmapped_area(),
    and and the vma tree's subtree_gap support for that.

    ALSA: timer: Fix missing queue indices reset at SNDRV_TIMER_IOCTL_SELECT
    
    snd_timer_user_tselect() reallocates the queue buffer dynamically, but
    it forgot to reset its indices.  Since the read may happen
    concurrently with ioctl and snd_timer_user_tselect() allocates the
    buffer via kmalloc(), this may lead to the leak of uninitialized
    kernel-space data, as spotted via KMSAN:

    ALSA: timer: Fix race between read and ioctl
    
    The read from ALSA timer device, the function snd_timer_user_tread(),
    may access to an uninitialized struct snd_timer_user fields when the
    read is concurrently performed while the ioctl like
    snd_timer_user_tselect() is invoked.  We have already fixed the races
    among ioctls via a mutex, but we seem to have forgotten the race
    between read vs ioctl.
    
    This patch simply applies (more exactly extends the already applied
    range of) tu->ioctl_lock in snd_timer_user_tread() for closing the
    race window.

    dccp/tcp: do not inherit mc_list from parent
    
    syzkaller found a way to trigger double frees from ip_mc_drop_socket()
    
    It turns out that leave a copy of parent mc_list at accept() time,
    which is very bad.
    
    Very similar to commit 8b485ce69876 ("tcp: do not inherit
    fastopen_req from parent")

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 2423496af35d94a87156b063ea5cedffc10a70a1
Author: Craig Gallek <kraig@google.com>

    ipv6: Prevent overrun when parsing v6 header options
    
    The KASAN warning repoted below was discovered with a syzkaller
    program.  The reproducer is basically:
      int s = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_RAW, NEXTHDR_HOP);
      send(s, &one_byte_of_data, 1, MSG_MORE);
      send(s, &more_than_mtu_bytes_data, 2000, 0);
    
    The socket() call sets the nexthdr field of the v6 header to
    NEXTHDR_HOP, the first send call primes the payload with a non zero
    byte of data, and the second send call triggers the fragmentation path.
    
    The fragmentation code tries to parse the header options in order
    to figure out where to insert the fragment option.  Since nexthdr points
    to an invalid option, the calculation of the size of the network header
    can made to be much larger than the linear section of the skb and data
    is read outside of it.
    
    This fix makes ip6_find_1stfrag return an error if it detects
    running out-of-bounds.

    sctp: do not inherit ipv6_{mc|ac|fl}_list from parent
    
    SCTP needs fixes similar to 83eaddab4378 ("ipv6/dccp: do not inherit
    ipv6_mc_list from parent"), otherwise bad things can happen.

    ipv6: fix out of bound writes in __ip6_append_data()
    
    Andrey Konovalov and idaifish@gmail.com reported crashes caused by
    one skb shared_info being overwritten from __ip6_append_data()
    
    Andrey program lead to following state :
    
    copy -4200 datalen 2000 fraglen 2040
    maxfraglen 2040 alloclen 2048 transhdrlen 0 offset 0 fraggap 6200
    
    The skb_copy_and_csum_bits(skb_prev, maxfraglen, data + transhdrlen,
    fraggap, 0); is overwriting skb->head and skb_shared_info
    
    Since we apparently detect this rare condition too late, move the
    code earlier to even avoid allocating skb and risking crashes.
    
    Once again, many thanks to Andrey and syzkaller team.
