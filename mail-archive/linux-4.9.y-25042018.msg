Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 8e4b5eae5decd9dfe5a4ee369c22028f90ab4c44
Author: Theodore Ts'o <tytso@mit.edu>
Date:   Thu Mar 29 21:56:09 2018 -0400

    ext4: fail ext4_iget for root directory if unallocated
    
    If the root directory has an i_links_count of zero, then when the file
    system is mounted, then when ext4_fill_super() notices the problem and
    tries to call iput() the root directory in the error return path,
    ext4_evict_inode() will try to free the inode on disk, before all of
    the file system structures are set up, and this will result in an OOPS
    caused by a NULL pointer dereference.
    
    This issue has been assigned CVE-2018-1092.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 18db4b4e6fc31eda838dd1c1296d67dbcb3dc957
Author: Theodore Ts'o <tytso@mit.edu>
Date:   Thu Mar 29 22:10:35 2018 -0400

    ext4: don't allow r/w mounts if metadata blocks overlap the superblock
    
    If some metadata block, such as an allocation bitmap, overlaps the
    superblock, it's very likely that if the file system is mounted
    read/write, the results will not be pretty.  So disallow r/w mounts
    for file systems corrupted in this particular way.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 43838a23a05fbd13e47d750d3dfd77001536dd33
Author: Theodore Ts'o <tytso@mit.edu>
Date:   Wed Apr 11 13:27:52 2018 -0400

    random: fix crng_ready() test
    
    The crng_init variable has three states:
    
    0: The CRNG is not initialized at all
    1: The CRNG has a small amount of entropy, hopefully good enough for
       early-boot, non-cryptographical use cases
    2: The CRNG is fully initialized and we are sure it is safe for
       cryptographic use cases.
    
    The crng_ready() function should only return true once we are in the
    last state.  This addresses CVE-2018-1108.

    drm: udl: Properly check framebuffer mmap offsets
    
    The memmap options sent to the udl framebuffer driver were not being
    checked for all sets of possible crazy values.  Fix this up by properly
    bounding the allowed values.
