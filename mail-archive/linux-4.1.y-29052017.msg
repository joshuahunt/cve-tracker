Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 197c949e7798fbf28cfadc69d9ca0c2abbf93191
Author: Eric Dumazet <edumazet@google.com>
Date:   Wed Dec 30 08:51:12 2015 -0500

    udp: properly support MSG_PEEK with truncated buffers
    
    Backport of this upstream commit into stable kernels :
    89c22d8c3b27 ("net: Fix skb csum races when peeking")
    exposed a bug in udp stack vs MSG_PEEK support, when user provides
    a buffer smaller than skb payload.
    
    In this case,
    skb_copy_and_csum_datagram_iovec(skb, sizeof(struct udphdr),
                                     msg->msg_iov);
    returns -EFAULT.
    
    This bug does not happen in upstream kernels since Al Viro did a great
    job to replace this into :
    skb_copy_and_csum_datagram_msg(skb, sizeof(struct udphdr), msg);
    This variant is safe vs short buffers.
    
    For the time being, instead reverting Herbert Xu patch and add back
    skb->ip_summed invalid changes, simply store the result of
    udp_lib_checksum_complete() so that we avoid computing the checksum a
    second time, and avoid the problematic
    skb_copy_and_csum_datagram_iovec() call.
    
    This patch can be applied on recent kernels as it avoids a double
    checksumming, then backported to stable kernels as a bug fix.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit ee8f844e3c5a73b999edf733df1c529d6503ec2f
Author: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>
Date:   Tue Apr 18 15:31:07 2017 +0100

    KEYS: Disallow keyrings beginning with '.' to be joined as session keyrings
    
    This fixes CVE-2016-9604.
    
    Keyrings whose name begin with a '.' are special internal keyrings and so
    userspace isn't allowed to create keyrings by this name to prevent
    shadowing.  However, the patch that added the guard didn't fix
    KEYCTL_JOIN_SESSION_KEYRING.  Not only can that create dot-named keyrings,
    it can also subscribe to them as a session keyring if they grant SEARCH
    permission to the user.
    
    This, for example, allows a root process to set .builtin_trusted_keys as
    its session keyring, at which point it has full access because now the
    possessor permissions are added.  This permits root to add extra public
    keys, thereby bypassing module verification.
    
    This also affects kexec and IMA.
    
    This can be tested by (as root):
    
    	keyctl session .builtin_trusted_keys
    	keyctl add user a a @s
    	keyctl list @s
    
    which on my test box gives me:
    
    	2 keys in keyring:
    	180010936: ---lswrv     0     0 asymmetric: Build time autogenerated kernel key: ae3d4a31b82daa8e1a75b49dc2bba949fd992a05
    	801382539: --alswrv     0     0 user: a
    
    
    Fix this by rejecting names beginning with a '.' in the keyctl.

commit 95e91b831f87ac8e1f8ed50c14d709089b4e01b8
Author: Davidlohr Bueso <dave@stgolabs.net>
Date:   Mon Feb 27 14:28:24 2017 -0800

    ipc/shm: Fix shmat mmap nil-page protection
    
    The issue is described here, with a nice testcase:
    
        https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=192931
    
    The problem is that shmat() calls do_mmap_pgoff() with MAP_FIXED, and
    the address rounded down to 0.  For the regular mmap case, the
    protection mentioned above is that the kernel gets to generate the
    address -- arch_get_unmapped_area() will always check for MAP_FIXED and
    return that address.  So by the time we do security_mmap_addr(0) things
    get funky for shmat().
    
    The testcase itself shows that while a regular user crashes, root will
    not have a problem attaching a nil-page.  There are two possible fixes
    to this.  The first, and which this patch does, is to simply allow root
    to crash as well -- this is also regular mmap behavior, ie when hacking
    up the testcase and adding mmap(...  |MAP_FIXED).  While this approach
    is the safer option, the second alternative is to ignore SHM_RND if the
    rounded address is 0, thus only having MAP_SHARED flags.  This makes the
    behavior of shmat() identical to the mmap() case.  The downside of this
    is obviously user visible, but does make sense in that it maintains
    semantics after the round-down wrt 0 address and mmap.
    
    Passes shm related ltp tests.

    drm/vmwgfx: fix integer overflow in vmw_surface_define_ioctl()
    
    In vmw_surface_define_ioctl(), the 'num_sizes' is the sum of the
    'req->mip_levels' array. This array can be assigned any value from
    the user space. As both the 'num_sizes' and the array is uint32_t,
    it is easy to make 'num_sizes' overflow. The later 'mip_levels' is
    used as the loop count. This can lead an oob write. Add the check of
    'req->mip_levels' to avoid this.

    KEYS: fix keyctl_set_reqkey_keyring() to not leak thread keyrings
    
    This fixes CVE-2017-7472.
    
    Running the following program as an unprivileged user exhausts kernel
    memory by leaking thread keyrings:
    
    	#include <keyutils.h>
    
    	int main()
    	{
    		for (;;)
    			keyctl_set_reqkey_keyring(KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_THREAD_KEYRING);
    	}
    
    Fix it by only creating a new thread keyring if there wasn't one before.
    To make things more consistent, make install_thread_keyring_to_cred()
    and install_process_keyring_to_cred() both return 0 if the corresponding
    keyring is already present.

    crypto: ahash - Fix EINPROGRESS notification callback
    
    The ahash API modifies the request's callback function in order
    to clean up after itself in some corner cases (unaligned final
    and missing finup).
    
    When the request is complete ahash will restore the original
    callback and everything is fine.  However, when the request gets
    an EBUSY on a full queue, an EINPROGRESS callback is made while
    the request is still ongoing.
    
    In this case the ahash API will incorrectly call its own callback.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by creating a temporary request
    object on the stack which is used to relay EINPROGRESS back to
    the original completion function.
    
    This patch also adds code to preserve the original flags value.

    nfsd: check for oversized NFSv2/v3 arguments
    
    A client can append random data to the end of an NFSv2 or NFSv3 RPC call
    without our complaining; we'll just stop parsing at the end of the
    expected data and ignore the rest.
    
    Encoded arguments and replies are stored together in an array of pages,
    and if a call is too large it could leave inadequate space for the
    reply.  This is normally OK because NFS RPC's typically have either
    short arguments and long replies (like READ) or long arguments and short
    replies (like WRITE).  But a client that sends an incorrectly long reply
    can violate those assumptions.  This was observed to cause crashes.
    
    Also, several operations increment rq_next_page in the decode routine
    before checking the argument size, which can leave rq_next_page pointing
    well past the end of the page array, causing trouble later in
    svc_free_pages.
    
    So, following a suggestion from Neil Brown, add a central check to
    enforce our expectation that no NFSv2/v3 call has both a large call and
    a large reply.
    
    As followup we may also want to rewrite the encoding routines to check
    more carefully that they aren't running off the end of the page array.
    
    We may also consider rejecting calls that have any extra garbage
    appended.  That would be safer, and within our rights by spec, but given
    the age of our server and the NFS protocol, and the fact that we've
    never enforced this before, we may need to balance that against the
    possibility of breaking some oddball client.

    USB: serial: io_ti: fix information leak in completion handler
    
    Add missing sanity check to the bulk-in completion handler to avoid an
    integer underflow that can be triggered by a malicious device.
    
    This avoids leaking 128 kB of memory content from after the URB transfer
    buffer to user space.
    
    Fixes: 8c209e6782ca ("USB: make actual_length in struct urb field u32")
    Fixes: 1da177e4c3f4 ("Linux-2.6.12-rc2")

    USB: serial: omninet: fix reference leaks at open
    
    This driver needlessly took another reference to the tty on open, a
    reference which was then never released on close. This lead to not just
    a leak of the tty, but also a driver reference leak that prevented the
    driver from being unloaded after a port had once been opened.
