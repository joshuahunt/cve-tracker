Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit a8f97366452ed491d13cf1e44241bc0b5740b1f0

    mm, thp: Do not make page table dirty unconditionally in touch_p[mu]d()
    
    Currently, we unconditionally make page table dirty in touch_pmd().
    It may result in false-positive can_follow_write_pmd().
    
    We may avoid the situation, if we would only make the page table entry
    dirty if caller asks for write access -- FOLL_WRITE.
    
    The patch also changes touch_pud() in the same way.
