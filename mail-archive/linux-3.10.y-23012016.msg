Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 7d267278a9ece963d77eefec61630223fce08c6c
Author: Rainer Weikusat <rweikusat@mobileactivedefense.com>

    unix: avoid use-after-free in ep_remove_wait_queue
    
    Rainer Weikusat <rweikusat@mobileactivedefense.com> writes:
    An AF_UNIX datagram socket being the client in an n:1 association with
    some server socket is only allowed to send messages to the server if the
    receive queue of this socket contains at most sk_max_ack_backlog
    datagrams. This implies that prospective writers might be forced to go
    to sleep despite none of the message presently enqueued on the server
    receive queue were sent by them. In order to ensure that these will be
    woken up once space becomes again available, the present unix_dgram_poll
    routine does a second sock_poll_wait call with the peer_wait wait queue
    of the server socket as queue argument (unix_dgram_recvmsg does a wake
    up on this queue after a datagram was received). This is inherently
    problematic because the server socket is only guaranteed to remain alive
    for as long as the client still holds a reference to it. In case the
    connection is dissolved via connect or by the dead peer detection logic
    in unix_dgram_sendmsg, the server socket may be freed despite "the
    polling mechanism" (in particular, epoll) still has a pointer to the
    corresponding peer_wait queue. There's no way to forcibly deregister a
    wait queue with epoll.
    
    Based on an idea by Jason Baron, the patch below changes the code such
    that a wait_queue_t belonging to the client socket is enqueued on the
    peer_wait queue of the server whenever the peer receive queue full
    condition is detected by either a sendmsg or a poll. A wake up on the
    peer queue is then relayed to the ordinary wait queue of the client
    socket via wake function. The connection to the peer wait queue is again
    dissolved if either a wake up is about to be relayed or the client
    socket reconnects or a dead peer is detected or the client socket is
    itself closed. This enables removing the second sock_poll_wait from
    unix_dgram_poll, thus avoiding the use-after-free, while still ensuring
    that no blocked writer sleeps forever.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit b4a1b4f5047e4f54e194681125c74c0aa64d637d
Author: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>
Date:   Fri Dec 18 01:34:26 2015 +0000

    KEYS: Fix race between read and revoke
    
    This fixes CVE-2015-7550.
    
    There's a race between keyctl_read() and keyctl_revoke().  If the revoke
    happens between keyctl_read() checking the validity of a key and the key's
    semaphore being taken, then the key type read method will see a revoked key.
    
    This causes a problem for the user-defined key type because it assumes in
    its read method that there will always be a payload in a non-revoked key
    and doesn't check for a NULL pointer.
    
    Fix this by making keyctl_read() check the validity of a key after taking
    semaphore instead of before.
    
    I think the bug was introduced with the original keyrings code.
    
    This was discovered by a multithreaded test program generated by syzkaller
    (http://github.com/google/syzkaller).  Here's a cleaned up version:
    
    	#include <sys/types.h>
    	#include <keyutils.h>
    	#include <pthread.h>
    	void *thr0(void *arg)
    	{
    		key_serial_t key = (unsigned long)arg;
    		keyctl_revoke(key);
    		return 0;
    	}
    	void *thr1(void *arg)
    	{
    		key_serial_t key = (unsigned long)arg;
    		char buffer[16];
    		keyctl_read(key, buffer, 16);
    		return 0;
    	}
    	int main()
    	{
    		key_serial_t key = add_key("user", "%", "foo", 3, KEY_SPEC_USER_KEYRING);
    		pthread_t th[5];
    		pthread_create(&th[0], 0, thr0, (void *)(unsigned long)key);
    		pthread_create(&th[1], 0, thr1, (void *)(unsigned long)key);
    		pthread_create(&th[2], 0, thr0, (void *)(unsigned long)key);
    		pthread_create(&th[3], 0, thr1, (void *)(unsigned long)key);
    		pthread_join(th[0], 0);
    		pthread_join(th[1], 0);
    		pthread_join(th[2], 0);
    		pthread_join(th[3], 0);
    		return 0;
    	}
    
    Build as:
    
    	cc -o keyctl-race keyctl-race.c -lkeyutils -lpthread
    
    Run as:
    
    	while keyctl-race; do :; done
    
    as it may need several iterations to crash the kernel.  The crash can be
    summarised as:
    
    	BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000010
    	IP: [<ffffffff81279b08>] user_read+0x56/0xa3

    KEYS: Fix crash when attempt to garbage collect an uninstantiated keyring
    
    The following sequence of commands:
    
        i=`keyctl add user a a @s`
        keyctl request2 keyring foo bar @t
        keyctl unlink $i @s
    
    tries to invoke an upcall to instantiate a keyring if one doesn't already
    exist by that name within the user's keyring set.  However, if the upcall
    fails, the code sets keyring->type_data.reject_error to -ENOKEY or some
    other error code.  When the key is garbage collected, the key destroy
    function is called unconditionally and keyring_destroy() uses list_empty()
    on keyring->type_data.link - which is in a union with reject_error.
    Subsequently, the kernel tries to unlink the keyring from the keyring names
    list - which oopses like this:
    
    	BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at 00000000ffffff8a

    Note the value in RAX.  This is a 32-bit representation of -ENOKEY.
    
    The solution is to only call ->destroy() if the key was successfully
    instantiated.
