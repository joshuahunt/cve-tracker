    HID: validate feature and input report details
    
    When dealing with usage_index, be sure to properly use unsigned instead of
    int to avoid overflows.
    
    When working on report fields, always validate that their report_counts are
    in bounds.
    Without this, a HID device could report a malicious feature report that
    could trick the driver into a heap overflow:
    
    [  634.885003] usb 1-1: New USB device found, idVendor=0596, idProduct=0500
    ...
    [  676.469629] BUG kmalloc-192 (Tainted: G        W   ): Redzone overwritten

    HID: multitouch: validate indexes details
    
    When working on report indexes, always validate that they are in bounds.
    Without this, a HID device could report a malicious feature report that
    could trick the driver into a heap overflow:
    
    [  634.885003] usb 1-1: New USB device found, idVendor=0596, idProduct=0500
    ...
    [  676.469629] BUG kmalloc-192 (Tainted: G        W   ): Redzone overwritten
    
    Note that we need to change the indexes from s8 to s16 as they can
    be between -1 and 255.
