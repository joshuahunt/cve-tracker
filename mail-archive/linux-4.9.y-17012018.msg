Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit bfedb589252c01fa505ac9f6f2a3d5d68d707ef4
Author: Eric W. Biederman <ebiederm@xmission.com>
Date:   Thu Oct 13 21:23:16 2016 -0500

    mm: Add a user_ns owner to mm_struct and fix ptrace permission checks
    
    During exec dumpable is cleared if the file that is being executed is
    not readable by the user executing the file.  A bug in
    ptrace_may_access allows reading the file if the executable happens to
    enter into a subordinate user namespace (aka clone(CLONE_NEWUSER),
    unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER), or setns(fd, CLONE_NEWUSER).
    
    This problem is fixed with only necessary userspace breakage by adding
    a user namespace owner to mm_struct, captured at the time of exec, so
    it is clear in which user namespace CAP_SYS_PTRACE must be present in
    to be able to safely give read permission to the executable.
    
    The function ptrace_may_access is modified to verify that the ptracer
    has CAP_SYS_ADMIN in task->mm->user_ns instead of task->cred->user_ns.
    This ensures that if the task changes it's cred into a subordinate
    user namespace it does not become ptraceable.
    
    The function ptrace_attach is modified to only set PT_PTRACE_CAP when
    CAP_SYS_PTRACE is held over task->mm->user_ns.  The intent of
    PT_PTRACE_CAP is to be a flag to note that whatever permission changes
    the task might go through the tracer has sufficient permissions for
    it not to be an issue.  task->cred->user_ns is always the same
    as or descendent of mm->user_ns.  Which guarantees that having
    CAP_SYS_PTRACE over mm->user_ns is the worst case for the tasks
    credentials.
    
    To prevent regressions mm->dumpable and mm->user_ns are not considered
    when a task has no mm.  As simply failing ptrace_may_attach causes
    regressions in privileged applications attempting to read things
    such as /proc/<pid>/stat

    sg_write()/bsg_write() is not fit to be called under KERNEL_DS
    
    Both damn things interpret userland pointers embedded into the payload;
    worse, they are actually traversing those.  Leaving aside the bad
    API design, this is very much _not_ safe to call with KERNEL_DS.
    Bail out early if that happens.

commit a45f795c65b479b4ba107b6ccde29b896d51ee98

    libceph: introduce ceph_crypt() for in-place en/decryption
    
    Starting with 4.9, kernel stacks may be vmalloced and therefore not
    guaranteed to be physically contiguous; the new CONFIG_VMAP_STACK
    option is enabled by default on x86.  This makes it invalid to use
    on-stack buffers with the crypto scatterlist API, as sg_set_buf()
    expects a logical address and won't work with vmalloced addresses.
    
    There isn't a different (e.g. kvec-based) crypto API we could switch
    net/ceph/crypto.c to and the current scatterlist.h API isn't getting
    updated to accommodate this use case.  Allocating a new header and
    padding for each operation is a non-starter, so do the en/decryption
    in-place on a single pre-assembled (header + data + padding) heap
    buffer.  This is explicitly supported by the crypto API:
    
        "... the caller may provide the same scatter/gather list for the
         plaintext and cipher text. After the completion of the cipher
         operation, the plaintext data is replaced with the ciphertext data
         in case of an encryption and vice versa for a decryption."

    cifs: Fix smbencrypt() to stop pointing a scatterlist at the stack
    
    smbencrypt() points a scatterlist to the stack, which is breaks if
    CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y.
    
    Fix it by switching to crypto_cipher_encrypt_one().  The new code
    should be considerably faster as an added benefit.
    
    This code is nearly identical to some code that Eric Biggers
    suggested.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 3a4b77cd47bb837b8557595ec7425f281f2ca1fe
Author: Eryu Guan <guaneryu@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Dec 1 15:08:37 2016 -0500

    ext4: validate s_first_meta_bg at mount time
    
    Ralf Spenneberg reported that he hit a kernel crash when mounting a
    modified ext4 image. And it turns out that kernel crashed when
    calculating fs overhead (ext4_calculate_overhead()), this is because
    the image has very large s_first_meta_bg (debug code shows it's
    842150400), and ext4 overruns the memory in count_overhead() when
    setting bitmap buffer, which is PAGE_SIZE.
    
    ext4_calculate_overhead():
      buf = get_zeroed_page(GFP_NOFS);  <=== PAGE_SIZE buffer
      blks = count_overhead(sb, i, buf);
    
    count_overhead():
      for (j = ext4_bg_num_gdb(sb, grp); j > 0; j--) { <=== j = 842150400
              ext4_set_bit(EXT4_B2C(sbi, s++), buf);   <=== buffer overrun
              count++;
      }
    
    This can be reproduced easily for me by this script:
    
      #!/bin/bash
      rm -f fs.img
      mkdir -p /mnt/ext4
      fallocate -l 16M fs.img
      mke2fs -t ext4 -O bigalloc,meta_bg,^resize_inode -F fs.img
      debugfs -w -R "ssv first_meta_bg 842150400" fs.img
      mount -o loop fs.img /mnt/ext4
    
    Fix it by validating s_first_meta_bg first at mount time, and
    refusing to mount if its value exceeds the largest possible meta_bg
    number.

    One cgroup maintainer mentioned that "cgroup is trying to offline
    a cpuset css, which takes place under cgroup_mutex.  The offlining
    ends up trying to drain active usages of a sysctl table which apprently
    is not happening."
    The real reason is that proc_sys_readdir doesn't drop reference added
    by grab_header when return from !dir_emit_dots path. So this cpuset
    offline path will wait here forever.

    KEYS: Disallow keyrings beginning with '.' to be joined as session keyrings
    
    This fixes CVE-2016-9604.
    
    Keyrings whose name begin with a '.' are special internal keyrings and so
    userspace isn't allowed to create keyrings by this name to prevent
    shadowing.  However, the patch that added the guard didn't fix
    KEYCTL_JOIN_SESSION_KEYRING.  Not only can that create dot-named keyrings,
    it can also subscribe to them as a session keyring if they grant SEARCH
    permission to the user.
    
    This, for example, allows a root process to set .builtin_trusted_keys as
    its session keyring, at which point it has full access because now the
    possessor permissions are added.  This permits root to add extra public
    keys, thereby bypassing module verification.
    
    This also affects kexec and IMA.
    
    This can be tested by (as root):
    
    	keyctl session .builtin_trusted_keys
    	keyctl add user a a @s
    	keyctl list @s
    
    which on my test box gives me:
    
    	2 keys in keyring:
    	180010936: ---lswrv     0     0 asymmetric: Build time autogenerated kernel key: ae3d4a31b82daa8e1a75b49dc2bba949fd992a05
    	801382539: --alswrv     0     0 user: a
    
    
    Fix this by rejecting names beginning with a '.' in the keyctl.

    powerpc/tm: Fix illegal TM state in signal handler
    
    Currently it's possible that on returning from the signal handler
    through the restore_tm_sigcontexts() code path (e.g. from a signal
    caught due to a `trap` instruction executed in the middle of an HTM
    block, or a deliberately constructed sigframe) an illegal TM state
    (like TS=10 TM=0, i.e. "T0") is set in SRR1 and when `rfid` sets
    implicitly the MSR register from SRR1 register on return to userspace
    it causes a TM Bad Thing exception.
    
    That illegal state can be set (a) by a malicious user that disables
    the TM bit by tweaking the bits in uc_mcontext before returning from
    the signal handler or (b) by a sufficient number of context switches
    occurring such that the load_tm counter overflows and TM is disabled
    whilst in the signal handler.
    
    This commit fixes the illegal TM state by ensuring that TM bit is
    always enabled before we return from restore_tm_sigcontexts(). A small
    comment correction is made as well.

    powerpc/64s: Use emergency stack for kernel TM Bad Thing program checks
    
    When using transactional memory (TM), the CPU can be in one of six
    states as far as TM is concerned, encoded in the Machine State
    Register (MSR). Certain state transitions are illegal and if attempted
    trigger a "TM Bad Thing" type program check exception.
    
    If we ever hit one of these exceptions it's treated as a bug, ie. we
    oops, and kill the process and/or panic, depending on configuration.
    
    One case where we can trigger a TM Bad Thing, is when returning to
    userspace after a system call or interrupt, using RFID. When this
    happens the CPU first restores the user register state, in particular
    r1 (the stack pointer) and then attempts to update the MSR. However
    the MSR update is not allowed and so we take the program check with
    the user register state, but the kernel MSR.
    
    This tricks the exception entry code into thinking we have a bad
    kernel stack pointer, because the MSR says we're coming from the
    kernel, but r1 is pointing to userspace.
    
    To avoid this we instead always switch to the emergency stack if we
    take a TM Bad Thing from the kernel. That way none of the user
    register values are used, other than for printing in the oops message.
    
    This is the fix for CVE-2017-1000255.

    mm: larger stack guard gap, between vmas
    
    Stack guard page is a useful feature to reduce a risk of stack smashing
    into a different mapping. We have been using a single page gap which
    is sufficient to prevent having stack adjacent to a different mapping.
    But this seems to be insufficient in the light of the stack usage in
    userspace. E.g. glibc uses as large as 64kB alloca() in many commonly
    used functions. Others use constructs liks gid_t buffer[NGROUPS_MAX]
    which is 256kB or stack strings with MAX_ARG_STRLEN.
    
    This will become especially dangerous for suid binaries and the default
    no limit for the stack size limit because those applications can be
    tricked to consume a large portion of the stack and a single glibc call
    could jump over the guard page. These attacks are not theoretical,
    unfortunatelly.
    
    Make those attacks less probable by increasing the stack guard gap
    to 1MB (on systems with 4k pages; but make it depend on the page size
    because systems with larger base pages might cap stack allocations in
    the PAGE_SIZE units) which should cover larger alloca() and VLA stack
    allocations. It is obviously not a full fix because the problem is
    somehow inherent, but it should reduce attack space a lot.
    
    One could argue that the gap size should be configurable from userspace,
    but that can be done later when somebody finds that the new 1MB is wrong
    for some special case applications.  For now, add a kernel command line
    option (stack_guard_gap) to specify the stack gap size (in page units).
    
    Implementation wise, first delete all the old code for stack guard page:
    because although we could get away with accounting one extra page in a
    stack vma, accounting a larger gap can break userspace - case in point,
    a program run with "ulimit -S -v 20000" failed when the 1MB gap was
    counted for RLIMIT_AS; similar problems could come with RLIMIT_MLOCK
    and strict non-overcommit mode.
    
    Instead of keeping gap inside the stack vma, maintain the stack guard
    gap as a gap between vmas: using vm_start_gap() in place of vm_start
    (or vm_end_gap() in place of vm_end if VM_GROWSUP) in just those few
    places which need to respect the gap - mainly arch_get_unmapped_area(),
    and and the vma tree's subtree_gap support for that.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 98da7d08850fb8bdeb395d6368ed15753304aa0c
Author: Kees Cook <keescook@chromium.org>
Date:   Fri Jun 23 15:08:57 2017 -0700

    fs/exec.c: account for argv/envp pointers
    
    When limiting the argv/envp strings during exec to 1/4 of the stack limit,
    the storage of the pointers to the strings was not included.  This means
    that an exec with huge numbers of tiny strings could eat 1/4 of the stack
    limit in strings and then additional space would be later used by the
    pointers to the strings.
    
    For example, on 32-bit with a 8MB stack rlimit, an exec with 1677721
    single-byte strings would consume less than 2MB of stack, the max (8MB /
    4) amount allowed, but the pointers to the strings would consume the
    remaining additional stack space (1677721 * 4 == 6710884).
    
    The result (1677721 + 6710884 == 8388605) would exhaust stack space
    entirely.  Controlling this stack exhaustion could result in
    pathological behavior in setuid binaries (CVE-2017-1000365).

commit eab09532d40090698b05a07c1c87f39fdbc5fab5
Author: Kees Cook <keescook@chromium.org>
Date:   Mon Jul 10 15:52:37 2017 -0700

    binfmt_elf: use ELF_ET_DYN_BASE only for PIE
    
    The ELF_ET_DYN_BASE position was originally intended to keep loaders
    away from ET_EXEC binaries.  (For example, running "/lib/ld-linux.so.2
    /bin/cat" might cause the subsequent load of /bin/cat into where the
    loader had been loaded.)
    
    With the advent of PIE (ET_DYN binaries with an INTERP Program Header),
    ELF_ET_DYN_BASE continued to be used since the kernel was only looking
    at ET_DYN.  However, since ELF_ET_DYN_BASE is traditionally set at the
    top 1/3rd of the TASK_SIZE, a substantial portion of the address space
    is unused.
    
    For 32-bit tasks when RLIMIT_STACK is set to RLIM_INFINITY, programs are
    loaded above the mmap region.  This means they can be made to collide
    (CVE-2017-1000370) or nearly collide (CVE-2017-1000371) with
    pathological stack regions.
    
    Lowering ELF_ET_DYN_BASE solves both by moving programs below the mmap
    region in all cases, and will now additionally avoid programs falling
    back to the mmap region by enforcing MAP_FIXED for program loads (i.e.
    if it would have collided with the stack, now it will fail to load
    instead of falling back to the mmap region).
    
    To allow for a lower ELF_ET_DYN_BASE, loaders (ET_DYN without INTERP)
    are loaded into the mmap region, leaving space available for either an
    ET_EXEC binary with a fixed location or PIE being loaded into mmap by
    the loader.  Only PIE programs are loaded offset from ELF_ET_DYN_BASE,
    which means architectures can now safely lower their values without risk
    of loaders colliding with their subsequently loaded programs.
    
    For 64-bit, ELF_ET_DYN_BASE is best set to 4GB to allow runtimes to use
    the entire 32-bit address space for 32-bit pointers.
    
    Thanks to PaX Team, Daniel Micay, and Rik van Riel for inspiration and
    suggestions on how to implement this solution.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 1be7107fbe18eed3e319a6c3e83c78254b693acb
Author: Hugh Dickins <hughd@google.com>
Date:   Mon Jun 19 04:03:24 2017 -0700

    mm: larger stack guard gap, between vmas
    
    Stack guard page is a useful feature to reduce a risk of stack smashing
    into a different mapping. We have been using a single page gap which
    is sufficient to prevent having stack adjacent to a different mapping.
    But this seems to be insufficient in the light of the stack usage in
    userspace. E.g. glibc uses as large as 64kB alloca() in many commonly
    used functions. Others use constructs liks gid_t buffer[NGROUPS_MAX]
    which is 256kB or stack strings with MAX_ARG_STRLEN.
    
    This will become especially dangerous for suid binaries and the default
    no limit for the stack size limit because those applications can be
    tricked to consume a large portion of the stack and a single glibc call
    could jump over the guard page. These attacks are not theoretical,
    unfortunatelly.
    
    Make those attacks less probable by increasing the stack guard gap
    to 1MB (on systems with 4k pages; but make it depend on the page size
    because systems with larger base pages might cap stack allocations in
    the PAGE_SIZE units) which should cover larger alloca() and VLA stack
    allocations. It is obviously not a full fix because the problem is
    somehow inherent, but it should reduce attack space a lot.
    
    One could argue that the gap size should be configurable from userspace,
    but that can be done later when somebody finds that the new 1MB is wrong
    for some special case applications.  For now, add a kernel command line
    option (stack_guard_gap) to specify the stack gap size (in page units).
    
    Implementation wise, first delete all the old code for stack guard page:
    because although we could get away with accounting one extra page in a
    stack vma, accounting a larger gap can break userspace - case in point,
    a program run with "ulimit -S -v 20000" failed when the 1MB gap was
    counted for RLIMIT_AS; similar problems could come with RLIMIT_MLOCK
    and strict non-overcommit mode.
    
    Instead of keeping gap inside the stack vma, maintain the stack guard
    gap as a gap between vmas: using vm_start_gap() in place of vm_start
    (or vm_end_gap() in place of vm_end if VM_GROWSUP) in just those few
    places which need to respect the gap - mainly arch_get_unmapped_area(),
    and and the vma tree's subtree_gap support for that.

    ALSA: timer: Fix missing queue indices reset at SNDRV_TIMER_IOCTL_SELECT
    
    snd_timer_user_tselect() reallocates the queue buffer dynamically, but
    it forgot to reset its indices.  Since the read may happen
    concurrently with ioctl and snd_timer_user_tselect() allocates the
    buffer via kmalloc(), this may lead to the leak of uninitialized
    kernel-space data, as spotted via KMSAN:

    ALSA: timer: Fix race between read and ioctl
    
    The read from ALSA timer device, the function snd_timer_user_tread(),
    may access to an uninitialized struct snd_timer_user fields when the
    read is concurrently performed while the ioctl like
    snd_timer_user_tselect() is invoked.  We have already fixed the races
    among ioctls via a mutex, but we seem to have forgotten the race
    between read vs ioctl.
    
    This patch simply applies (more exactly extends the already applied
    range of) tu->ioctl_lock in snd_timer_user_tread() for closing the
    race window.

    mm, thp: Do not make page table dirty unconditionally in touch_p[mu]d()
    
    Currently, we unconditionally make page table dirty in touch_pmd().
    It may result in false-positive can_follow_write_pmd().
    
    We may avoid the situation, if we would only make the page table entry
    dirty if caller asks for write access -- FOLL_WRITE.
    
    The patch also changes touch_pud() in the same way.

    KVM: VMX: remove I/O port 0x80 bypass on Intel hosts
    
    This fixes CVE-2017-1000407.
    
    KVM allows guests to directly access I/O port 0x80 on Intel hosts.  If
    the guest floods this port with writes it generates exceptions and
    instability in the host kernel, leading to a crash.  With this change
    guest writes to port 0x80 on Intel will behave the same as they
    currently behave on AMD systems.
    
    Prevent the flooding by removing the code that sets port 0x80 as a
    passthrough port.  This is essentially the same as upstream patch
    99f85a28a78e96d28907fe036e1671a218fee597, except that patch was
    for AMD chipsets and this patch is for Intel.

    timerfd: Protect the might cancel mechanism proper
    
    The handling of the might_cancel queueing is not properly protected, so
    parallel operations on the file descriptor can race with each other and
    lead to list corruptions or use after free.
    
    Protect the context for these operations with a seperate lock.
    
    The wait queue lock cannot be reused for this because that would create a
    lock inversion scenario vs. the cancel lock. Replacing might_cancel with an
    atomic (atomic_t or atomic bit) does not help either because it still can
    race vs. the actual list operation.

    mqueue: fix a use-after-free in sys_mq_notify()
    
    The retry logic for netlink_attachskb() inside sys_mq_notify()
    is nasty and vulnerable:
    
    1) The sock refcnt is already released when retry is needed
    2) The fd is controllable by user-space because we already
       release the file refcnt
    
    so we when retry but the fd has been just closed by user-space
    during this small window, we end up calling netlink_detachskb()
    on the error path which releases the sock again, later when
    the user-space closes this socket a use-after-free could be
    triggered.
    
    Setting 'sock' to NULL here should be sufficient to fix it.

    x86/acpi: Prevent out of bound access caused by broken ACPI tables
    
    The bus_irq argument of mp_override_legacy_irq() is used as the index into
    the isa_irq_to_gsi[] array. The bus_irq argument originates from
    ACPI_MADT_TYPE_IO_APIC and ACPI_MADT_TYPE_INTERRUPT items in the ACPI
    tables, but is nowhere sanity checked.
    
    That allows broken or malicious ACPI tables to overwrite memory, which
    might cause malfunction, panic or arbitrary code execution.
    
    Add a sanity check and emit a warning when that triggers.

    xen: fix bio vec merging
    
    The current test for bio vec merging is not fully accurate and can be
    tricked into merging bios when certain grant combinations are used.
    The result of these malicious bio merges is a bio that extends past
    the memory page used by any of the originating bios.
    
    Take into account the following scenario, where a guest creates two
    grant references that point to the same mfn, ie: grant 1 -> mfn A,
    grant 2 -> mfn A.
    
    These references are then used in a PV block request, and mapped by
    the backend domain, thus obtaining two different pfns that point to
    the same mfn, pfn B -> mfn A, pfn C -> mfn A.
    
    If those grants happen to be used in two consecutive sectors of a disk
    IO operation becoming two different bios in the backend domain, the
    checks in xen_biovec_phys_mergeable will succeed, because bfn1 == bfn2
    (they both point to the same mfn). However due to the bio merging,
    the backend domain will end up with a bio that expands past mfn A into
    mfn A + 1.
    
    Fix this by making sure the check in xen_biovec_phys_mergeable takes
    into account the offset and the length of the bio, this basically
    replicates whats done in __BIOVEC_PHYS_MERGEABLE using mfns (bus
    addresses). While there also remove the usage of
    __BIOVEC_PHYS_MERGEABLE, since that's already checked by the callers
    of xen_biovec_phys_mergeable.

    KVM: MMU: always terminate page walks at level 1
    
    is_last_gpte() is not equivalent to the pseudo-code given in commit
    6bb69c9b69c31 ("KVM: MMU: simplify last_pte_bitmap") because an incorrect
    value of last_nonleaf_level may override the result even if level == 1.
    
    It is critical for is_last_gpte() to return true on level == 1 to
    terminate page walks. Otherwise memory corruption may occur as level
    is used as an index to various data structures throughout the page
    walking code.  Even though the actual bug would be wherever the MMU is
    initialized (as in the previous patch), be defensive and ensure here
    that is_last_gpte() returns the correct value.
    
    This patch is also enough to fix CVE-2017-12188.

    KVM: nVMX: update last_nonleaf_level when initializing nested EPT
    
    The function updates context->root_level but didn't call
    update_last_nonleaf_level so the previous and potentially wrong value
    was used for page walks.  For example, a zero value of last_nonleaf_level
    would allow a potential out-of-bounds access in arch/x86/mmu/paging_tmpl.h's
    walk_addr_generic function (CVE-2017-12188).

    KEYS: prevent KEYCTL_READ on negative key
    
    Because keyctl_read_key() looks up the key with no permissions
    requested, it may find a negatively instantiated key.  If the key is
    also possessed, we went ahead and called ->read() on the key.  But the
    key payload will actually contain the ->reject_error rather than the
    normal payload.  Thus, the kernel oopses trying to read the
    user_key_payload from memory address (int)-ENOKEY = 0x00000000ffffff82.
    
    Fortunately the payload data is stored inline, so it shouldn't be
    possible to abuse this as an arbitrary memory read primitive...
    
    Reproducer:
        keyctl new_session
        keyctl request2 user desc '' @s
        keyctl read $(keyctl show | awk '/user: desc/ {print $1}')
    
    It causes a crash like the following:

    assoc_array: Fix a buggy node-splitting case
    
    This fixes CVE-2017-12193.
    
    Fix a case in the assoc_array implementation in which a new leaf is
    added that needs to go into a node that happens to be full, where the
    existing leaves in that node cluster together at that level to the
    exclusion of new leaf.
    
    What needs to happen is that the existing leaves get moved out to a new
    node, N1, at level + 1 and the existing node needs replacing with one,
    N0, that has pointers to the new leaf and to N1.
    
    The code that tries to do this gets this wrong in two ways:
    
     (1) The pointer that should've pointed from N0 to N1 is set to point
         recursively to N0 instead.
    
     (2) The backpointer from N0 needs to be set correctly in the case N0 is
         either the root node or reached through a shortcut.
    
    Fix this by removing this path and using the split_node path instead,
    which achieves the same end, but in a more general way (thanks to Eric
    Biggers for spotting the redundancy).
    
    The problem manifests itself as:
    
      BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000010

    staging: android: ashmem: fix a race condition in ASHMEM_SET_SIZE ioctl
    
    A lock-unlock is missing in ASHMEM_SET_SIZE ioctl which can result in a
    race condition when mmap is called. After the !asma->file check, before
    setting asma->size, asma->file can be set in mmap. That would result in
    having different asma->size than the mapped memory size. Combined with
    ASHMEM_UNPIN ioctl and shrinker invocation, this can result in memory
    corruption.

    scsi: qla2xxx: Fix an integer overflow in sysfs code
    
    The value of "size" comes from the user.  When we add "start + size" it
    could lead to an integer overflow bug.
    
    It means we vmalloc() a lot more memory than we had intended.  I believe
    that on 64 bit systems vmalloc() can succeed even if we ask it to
    allocate huge 4GB buffers.  So we would get memory corruption and likely
    a crash when we call ha->isp_ops->write_optrom() and ->read_optrom().
    
    Only root can trigger this bug.

    Sanitize 'move_pages()' permission checks
    
    The 'move_paghes()' system call was introduced long long ago with the
    same permission checks as for sending a signal (except using
    CAP_SYS_NICE instead of CAP_SYS_KILL for the overriding capability).
    
    That turns out to not be a great choice - while the system call really
    only moves physical page allocations around (and you need other
    capabilities to do a lot of it), you can check the return value to map
    out some the virtual address choices and defeat ASLR of a binary that
    still shares your uid.
    
    So change the access checks to the more common 'ptrace_may_access()'
    model instead.
    
    This tightens the access checks for the uid, and also effectively
    changes the CAP_SYS_NICE check to CAP_SYS_PTRACE, but it's unlikely that
    anybody really _uses_ this legacy system call any more (we hav ebetter
    NUMA placement models these days), so I expect nobody to notice.
    
    Famous last words.

    xfs: XFS_IS_REALTIME_INODE() should be false if no rt device present
    
    If using a kernel with CONFIG_XFS_RT=y and we set the RHINHERIT flag on
    a directory in a filesystem that does not have a realtime device and
    create a new file in that directory, it gets marked as a real time file.
    When data is written and a fsync is issued, the filesystem attempts to
    flush a non-existent rt device during the fsync process.
    
    This results in a crash dereferencing a null buftarg pointer in
    xfs_blkdev_issue_flush():

    sctp: do not peel off an assoc from one netns to another one
    
    Now when peeling off an association to the sock in another netns, all
    transports in this assoc are not to be rehashed and keep use the old
    key in hashtable.
    
    As a transport uses sk->net as the hash key to insert into hashtable,
    it would miss removing these transports from hashtable due to the new
    netns when closing the sock and all transports are being freeed, then
    later an use-after-free issue could be caused when looking up an asoc
    and dereferencing those transports.
    
    This is a very old issue since very beginning, ChunYu found it with
    syzkaller fuzz testing with this series:
    
      socket$inet6_sctp()
      bind$inet6()
      sendto$inet6()
      unshare(0x40000000)
      getsockopt$inet_sctp6_SCTP_GET_ASSOC_ID_LIST()
      getsockopt$inet_sctp6_SCTP_SOCKOPT_PEELOFF()
    
    This patch is to block this call when peeling one assoc off from one
    netns to another one, so that the netns of all transport would not
    go out-sync with the key in hashtable.
    
    Note that this patch didn't fix it by rehashing transports, as it's
    difficult to handle the situation when the tuple is already in use
    in the new netns. Besides, no one would like to peel off one assoc
    to another netns, considering ipaddrs, ifaces, etc. are usually
    different.

    net: Fix double free and memory corruption in get_net_ns_by_id()
    
    (I can trivially verify that that idr_remove in cleanup_net happens
     after the network namespace count has dropped to zero --EWB)
    
    Function get_net_ns_by_id() does not check for net::count
    after it has found a peer in netns_ids idr.
    
    It may dereference a peer, after its count has already been
    finaly decremented. This leads to double free and memory
    corruption:
    
    put_net(peer)                                   rtnl_lock()
    atomic_dec_and_test(&peer->count) [count=0]     ...
    __put_net(peer)                                 get_net_ns_by_id(net, id)
      spin_lock(&cleanup_list_lock)
      list_add(&net->cleanup_list, &cleanup_list)
      spin_unlock(&cleanup_list_lock)
    queue_work()                                      peer = idr_find(&net->netns_ids, id)
      |                                               get_net(peer) [count=1]
      |                                               ...
      |                                               (use after final put)

        ...                                           ...

        ...                                               list_add(&net->cleanup_list, &cleanup_list)
        ...                                               spin_unlock(&cleanup_list_lock)

        rtnl_lock()                                   ...
        for_each_net(tmp) {                           ...
          id = __peernet2id(tmp, peer)                ...
          spin_lock_irq(&tmp->nsid_lock)              ...
          idr_remove(&tmp->netns_ids, id)             ...

    	net_free(peer)                            ...
        }                                             ...
      |
      v
      cleanup_net()
        ...
        (Second free of peer)
    
    Also, put_net() on the right cpu may reorder with left's cpu
    list_replace_init(&cleanup_list, ..), and then cleanup_list
    will be corrupted.
    
    Since cleanup_net() is executed in worker thread, while
    put_net(peer) can happen everywhere, there should be
    enough time for concurrent get_net_ns_by_id() to pick
    the peer up, and the race does not seem to be unlikely.
    The patch fixes the problem in standard way.
    
    (Also, there is possible problem in peernet2id_alloc(), which requires
    check for net::count under nsid_lock and maybe_get_net(peer), but
    in current stable kernel it's used under rtnl_lock() and it has to be
    safe. Openswitch begun to use peernet2id_alloc(), and possibly it should
    be fixed too. While this is not in stable kernel yet, so I'll send
    a separate message to netdev@ later).

    ALSA: seq: Fix use-after-free at creating a port
    
    There is a potential race window opened at creating and deleting a
    port via ioctl, as spotted by fuzzing.  snd_seq_create_port() creates
    a port object and returns its pointer, but it doesn't take the
    refcount, thus it can be deleted immediately by another thread.
    Meanwhile, snd_seq_ioctl_create_port() still calls the function
    snd_seq_system_client_ev_port_start() with the created port object
    that is being deleted, and this triggers use-after-free like:

      .....
    
    We may fix this in a few different ways, and in this patch, it's fixed
    simply by taking the refcount properly at snd_seq_create_port() and
    letting the caller unref the object after use.  Also, there is another
    potential use-after-free by sprintf() call in snd_seq_create_port(),
    and this is moved inside the lock.
    
    This fix covers CVE-2017-15265.

    KEYS: fix dereferencing NULL payload with nonzero length
    
    sys_add_key() and the KEYCTL_UPDATE operation of sys_keyctl() allowed a
    NULL payload with nonzero length to be passed to the key type's
    ->preparse(), ->instantiate(), and/or ->update() methods.  Various key
    types including asymmetric, cifs.idmap, cifs.spnego, and pkcs7_test did
    not handle this case, allowing an unprivileged user to trivially cause a
    NULL pointer dereference (kernel oops) if one of these key types was
    present.  Fix it by doing the copy_from_user() when 'plen' is nonzero
    rather than when '_payload' is non-NULL, causing the syscall to fail
    with EFAULT as expected when an invalid buffer is specified.

    Currently, when passed a key that already exists, add_key() will call the
    key's ->update() method if such exists.  But this is heavily broken in the
    case where the key is uninstantiated because it doesn't call
    __key_instantiate_and_link().  Consequently, it doesn't do most of the
    things that are supposed to happen when the key is instantiated, such as
    setting the instantiation state, clearing KEY_FLAG_USER_CONSTRUCT and
    awakening tasks waiting on it, and incrementing key->user->nikeys.
    
    It also never takes key_construction_mutex, which means that
    ->instantiate() can run concurrently with ->update() on the same key.  In
    the case of the "user" and "logon" key types this causes a memory leak, at
    best.  Maybe even worse, the ->update() methods of the "encrypted" and
    "trusted" key types actually just dereference a NULL pointer when passed an
    uninstantiated key.
    
    Change key_create_or_update() to wait interruptibly for the key to finish
    construction before continuing.
    
    This patch only affects *uninstantiated* keys.  For now we still allow a
    negatively instantiated key to be updated (thereby positively
    instantiating it), although that's broken too (the next patch fixes it)
    and I'm not sure that anyone actually uses that functionality either.
    
    Here is a simple reproducer for the bug using the "encrypted" key type
    (requires CONFIG_ENCRYPTED_KEYS=y), though as noted above the bug
    pertained to more than just the "encrypted" key type:
    
        #include <stdlib.h>
        #include <unistd.h>
        #include <keyutils.h>
    
        int main(void)
        {
            int ringid = keyctl_join_session_keyring(NULL);
    
            if (fork()) {
                for (;;) {
                    const char payload[] = "update user:foo 32";
    
                    usleep(rand() % 10000);
                    add_key("encrypted", "desc", payload, sizeof(payload), ringid);
                    keyctl_clear(ringid);
                }
            } else {
                for (;;)
                    request_key("encrypted", "desc", "callout_info", ringid);
            }
        }
    
    It causes:

    KVM: PPC: Fix oops when checking KVM_CAP_PPC_HTM
    
    The following program causes a kernel oops:
    
    #include <sys/types.h>
    #include <sys/stat.h>
    #include <fcntl.h>
    #include <sys/ioctl.h>
    #include <linux/kvm.h>
    
    main()
    {
        int fd = open("/dev/kvm", O_RDWR);
        ioctl(fd, KVM_CHECK_EXTENSION, KVM_CAP_PPC_HTM);
    }
    
    This happens because when using the global KVM fd with
    KVM_CHECK_EXTENSION, kvm_vm_ioctl_check_extension() gets
    called with a NULL kvm argument, which gets dereferenced
    in is_kvmppc_hv_enabled(). Spotted while reading the code.
    
    Let's use the hv_enabled fallback variable, like everywhere
    else in this function.

commit 814fb7bb7db5433757d76f4c4502c96fc53b0b5e
Author: Eric Biggers <ebiggers@google.com>
Date:   Sat Sep 23 15:00:07 2017 +0200

    x86/fpu: Don't let userspace set bogus xcomp_bv
    
    On x86, userspace can use the ptrace() or rt_sigreturn() system calls to
    set a task's extended state (xstate) or "FPU" registers.  ptrace() can
    set them for another task using the PTRACE_SETREGSET request with
    NT_X86_XSTATE, while rt_sigreturn() can set them for the current task.
    In either case, registers can be set to any value, but the kernel
    assumes that the XSAVE area itself remains valid in the sense that the
    CPU can restore it.
    
    However, in the case where the kernel is using the uncompacted xstate
    format (which it does whenever the XSAVES instruction is unavailable),
    it was possible for userspace to set the xcomp_bv field in the
    xstate_header to an arbitrary value.  However, all bits in that field
    are reserved in the uncompacted case, so when switching to a task with
    nonzero xcomp_bv, the XRSTOR instruction failed with a #GP fault.  This
    caused the WARN_ON_FPU(err) in copy_kernel_to_xregs() to be hit.  In
    addition, since the error is otherwise ignored, the FPU registers from
    the task previously executing on the CPU were leaked.
    
    Fix the bug by checking that the user-supplied value of xcomp_bv is 0 in
    the uncompacted case, and returning an error otherwise.
    
    The reason for validating xcomp_bv rather than simply overwriting it
    with 0 is that we want userspace to see an error if it (incorrectly)
    provides an XSAVE area in compacted format rather than in uncompacted
    format.
    
    Note that as before, in case of error we clear the task's FPU state.
    This is perhaps non-ideal, especially for PTRACE_SETREGSET; it might be
    better to return an error before changing anything.  But it seems the
    "clear on error" behavior is fine for now, and it's a little tricky to
    do otherwise because it would mean we couldn't simply copy the full
    userspace state into kernel memory in one __copy_from_user().
    
    This bug was found by syzkaller, which hit the above-mentioned
    WARN_ON_FPU():

    forever with no output.  However, on a buggy kernel running on a
    processor with the "xsave" feature but without the "xsaves" feature
    (e.g. Sandy Bridge through Broadwell for Intel), within a second or two
    the program reports that the xmm registers were corrupted, i.e. were not
    restored correctly.  With CONFIG_X86_DEBUG_FPU=y it also hits the above
    kernel warning.

        }
    
    Note: the program only tests for the bug using the ptrace() system call.
    The bug can also be reproduced using the rt_sigreturn() system call, but
    only when called from a 32-bit program, since for 64-bit programs the
    kernel restores the FPU state from the signal frame by doing XRSTOR
    directly from userspace memory (with proper error checking).

    packet: hold bind lock when rebinding to fanout hook
    
    Packet socket bind operations must hold the po->bind_lock. This keeps
    po->running consistent with whether the socket is actually on a ptype
    list to receive packets.
    
    fanout_add unbinds a socket and its packet_rcv/tpacket_rcv call, then
    binds the fanout object to receive through packet_rcv_fanout.
    
    Make it hold the po->bind_lock when testing po->running and rebinding.
    Else, it can race with other rebind operations, such as that in
    packet_set_ring from packet_rcv to tpacket_rcv. Concurrent updates
    can result in a socket being added to a fanout group twice, causing
    use-after-free KASAN bug reports, among others.
    
    Reported independently by both trinity and syzkaller.
    Verified that the syzkaller reproducer passes after this patch.

    packet: in packet_do_bind, test fanout with bind_lock held
    
    Once a socket has po->fanout set, it remains a member of the group
    until it is destroyed. The prot_hook must be constant and identical
    across sockets in the group.
    
    If fanout_add races with packet_do_bind between the test of po->fanout
    and taking the lock, the bind call may make type or dev inconsistent
    with that of the fanout group.
    
    Hold po->bind_lock when testing po->fanout to avoid this race.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 363b02dab09b3226f3bd1420dad9c72b79a42a76
Author: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>
Date:   Wed Oct 4 16:43:25 2017 +0100

    KEYS: Fix race between updating and finding a negative key
    
    Consolidate KEY_FLAG_INSTANTIATED, KEY_FLAG_NEGATIVE and the rejection
    error into one field such that:
    
     (1) The instantiation state can be modified/read atomically.
    
     (2) The error can be accessed atomically with the state.
    
     (3) The error isn't stored unioned with the payload pointers.
    
    This deals with the problem that the state is spread over three different
    objects (two bits and a separate variable) and reading or updating them
    atomically isn't practical, given that not only can uninstantiated keys
    change into instantiated or rejected keys, but rejected keys can also turn
    into instantiated keys - and someone accessing the key might not be using
    any locking.
    
    The main side effect of this problem is that what was held in the payload
    may change, depending on the state.  For instance, you might observe the
    key to be in the rejected state.  You then read the cached error, but if
    the key semaphore wasn't locked, the key might've become instantiated
    between the two reads - and you might now have something in hand that isn't
    actually an error code.
    
    The state is now KEY_IS_UNINSTANTIATED, KEY_IS_POSITIVE or a negative error
    code if the key is negatively instantiated.  The key_is_instantiated()
    function is replaced with key_is_positive() to avoid confusion as negative
    keys are also 'instantiated'.
    
    Additionally, barriering is included:
    
     (1) Order payload-set before state-set during instantiation.
    
     (2) Order state-read before payload-read when using the key.
    
    Further separate barriering is necessary if RCU is being used to access the
    payload content after reading the payload pointers.

    Also introduce a new flag, disconnected, to struct usb_mixer_interface
    for not performing the disconnection procedure twice.

commit 786de92b3cb26012d3d0f00ee37adf14527f35c4
Author: Alan Stern <stern@rowland.harvard.edu>
Date:   Fri Sep 22 11:56:49 2017 -0400

    USB: uas: fix bug in handling of alternate settings
    
    The uas driver has a subtle bug in the way it handles alternate
    settings.  The uas_find_uas_alt_setting() routine returns an
    altsetting value (the bAlternateSetting number in the descriptor), but
    uas_use_uas_driver() then treats that value as an index to the
    intf->altsetting array, which it isn't.
    
    Normally this doesn't cause any problems because the various
    alternate settings have bAlternateSetting values 0, 1, 2, ..., so the
    value is equal to the index in the array.  But this is not guaranteed,
    and Andrey Konovalov used the syzkaller fuzzer with KASAN to get a
    slab-out-of-bounds error by violating this assumption.
    
    This patch fixes the bug by making uas_find_uas_alt_setting() return a
    pointer to the altsetting entry rather than either the value or the
    index.  Pointers are less subject to misinterpretation.

    USB: fix out-of-bounds in usb_set_configuration
    
    Andrey Konovalov reported a possible out-of-bounds problem for a USB interface
    association descriptor.  He writes:
    	It seems there's no proper size check of a USB_DT_INTERFACE_ASSOCIATION
    	descriptor. It's only checked that the size is >= 2 in
    	usb_parse_configuration(), so find_iad() might do out-of-bounds access
    	to intf_assoc->bInterfaceCount.
    
    And he's right, we don't check for crazy descriptors of this type very well, so
    resolve this problem.  Yet another issue found by syzkaller...

    usb: usbtest: fix NULL pointer dereference
    
    If the usbtest driver encounters a device with an IN bulk endpoint but
    no OUT bulk endpoint, it will try to dereference a NULL pointer
    (out->desc.bEndpointAddress).  The problem can be solved by adding a
    missing test.

    HID: usbhid: fix out-of-bounds bug
    
    The hid descriptor identifies the length and type of subordinate
    descriptors for a device. If the received hid descriptor is smaller than
    the size of the struct hid_descriptor, it is possible to cause
    out-of-bounds.
    
    In addition, if bNumDescriptors of the hid descriptor have an incorrect
    value, this can also cause out-of-bounds while approaching hdesc->desc[n].
    
    So check the size of hid descriptor and bNumDescriptors.

    USB: core: harden cdc_parse_cdc_header
    
    Andrey Konovalov reported a possible out-of-bounds problem for the
    cdc_parse_cdc_header function.  He writes:
    	It looks like cdc_parse_cdc_header() doesn't validate buflen
    	before accessing buffer[1], buffer[2] and so on. The only check
    	present is while (buflen > 0).
    
    So fix this issue up by properly validating the buffer length matches
    what the descriptor says it is.

    USB: core: fix out-of-bounds access bug in usb_get_bos_descriptor()
    
    Andrey used the syzkaller fuzzer to find an out-of-bounds memory
    access in usb_get_bos_descriptor().  The code wasn't checking that the
    next usb_dev_cap_header structure could fit into the remaining buffer
    space.
    
    This patch fixes the error and also reduces the bNumDeviceCaps field
    in the header to match the actual number of capabilities found, in
    cases where there are fewer than expected.

    dvb_detach(arg) calls symbol_put_addr(arg), where arg should be a pointer

    net: usb: asix: fill null-ptr-deref in asix_suspend
    
    When asix_suspend() is called dev->driver_priv might not have been
    assigned a value, so we need to check that it's not NULL.
    
    Similar issue is present in asix_resume(), this patch fixes it as well.
    
    Found by syzkaller.

    ipsec: Fix aborted xfrm policy dump crash
    
    An independent security researcher, Mohamed Ghannam, has reported
    this vulnerability to Beyond Security's SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure
    program.
    
    The xfrm_dump_policy_done function expects xfrm_dump_policy to
    have been called at least once or it will crash.  This can be
    triggered if a dump fails because the target socket's receive
    buffer is full.
    
    This patch fixes it by using the cb->start mechanism to ensure that
    the initialisation is always done regardless of the buffer situation.

    mm/pagewalk.c: report holes in hugetlb ranges
    
    This matters at least for the mincore syscall, which will otherwise copy
    uninitialized memory from the page allocator to userspace.  It is
    probably also a correctness error for /proc/$pid/pagemap, but I haven't
    tested that.
    
    Removing the `walk->hugetlb_entry` condition in walk_hugetlb_range() has
    no effect because the caller already checks for that.
    
    This only reports holes in hugetlb ranges to callers who have specified
    a hugetlb_entry callback.
    
    This issue was found using an AFL-based fuzzer.

    fork: fix incorrect fput of ->exe_file causing use-after-free
    
    Commit 7c051267931a ("mm, fork: make dup_mmap wait for mmap_sem for
    write killable") made it possible to kill a forking task while it is
    waiting to acquire its ->mmap_sem for write, in dup_mmap().
    
    However, it was overlooked that this introduced an new error path before
    a reference is taken on the mm_struct's ->exe_file.  Since the
    ->exe_file of the new mm_struct was already set to the old ->exe_file by
    the memcpy() in dup_mm(), it was possible for the mmput() in the error
    path of dup_mm() to drop a reference to ->exe_file which was never
    taken.
    
    This caused the struct file to later be freed prematurely.
    
    Fix it by updating mm_init() to NULL out the ->exe_file, in the same
    place it clears other things like the list of mmaps.
    
    This bug was found by syzkaller.  It can be reproduced using the
    following C program:
    
        #define _GNU_SOURCE
        #include <pthread.h>
        #include <stdlib.h>
        #include <sys/mman.h>
        #include <sys/syscall.h>
        #include <sys/wait.h>
        #include <unistd.h>
    
        static void *mmap_thread(void *_arg)
        {
            for (;;) {
                mmap(NULL, 0x1000000, PROT_READ,
                     MAP_POPULATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS|MAP_PRIVATE, -1, 0);
            }
        }
    
        static void *fork_thread(void *_arg)
        {
            usleep(rand() % 10000);
            fork();
        }
    
        int main(void)
        {
            fork();
            fork();
            fork();
            for (;;) {
                if (fork() == 0) {
                    pthread_t t;
    
                    pthread_create(&t, NULL, mmap_thread, NULL);
                    pthread_create(&t, NULL, fork_thread, NULL);
                    usleep(rand() % 10000);
                    syscall(__NR_exit_group, 0);
                }
                wait(NULL);
            }
        }
    
    No special kernel config options are needed.  It usually causes a NULL
    pointer dereference in __remove_shared_vm_struct() during exit, or in
    dup_mmap() (which is usually inlined into copy_process()) during fork.
    Both are due to a vm_area_struct's ->vm_file being used after it's
    already been freed.

    x86/mm: Fix use-after-free of ldt_struct
    
    The following commit:
    
      39a0526fb3f7 ("x86/mm: Factor out LDT init from context init")
    
    renamed init_new_context() to init_new_context_ldt() and added a new
    init_new_context() which calls init_new_context_ldt().  However, the
    error code of init_new_context_ldt() was ignored.  Consequently, if a
    memory allocation in alloc_ldt_struct() failed during a fork(), the
    ->context.ldt of the new task remained the same as that of the old task
    (due to the memcpy() in dup_mm()).  ldt_struct's are not intended to be
    shared, so a use-after-free occurred after one task exited.
    
    Fix the bug by making init_new_context() pass through the error code of
    init_new_context_ldt().
    
    This bug was found by syzkaller, which encountered the following splat:

    Note: the reproducer takes advantage of the fact that alloc_ldt_struct()
    may use vmalloc() to allocate a large ->entries array, and after
    commit:
    
      5d17a73a2ebe ("vmalloc: back off when the current task is killed")
    
    it is possible for userspace to fail a task's vmalloc() by
    sending a fatal signal, e.g. via exit_group().  It would be more
    difficult to reproduce this bug on kernels without that commit.
    
    This bug only affected kernels with CONFIG_MODIFY_LDT_SYSCALL=y.

    USB: core: prevent malicious bNumInterfaces overflow
    
    A malicious USB device with crafted descriptors can cause the kernel
    to access unallocated memory by setting the bNumInterfaces value too
    high in a configuration descriptor.  Although the value is adjusted
    during parsing, this adjustment is skipped in one of the error return
    paths.
    
    This patch prevents the problem by setting bNumInterfaces to 0
    initially.  The existing code already sets it to the proper value
    after parsing is complete.

    The path of patched vmmcall will patch 3 bytes opcode 0F 01 C1(vmcall)

    leaks 5 bytes from the kernel stack (CVE-2017-17741).  This patch fixes
    it by just accessing the bytes which we operate on.

    crypto: salsa20 - fix blkcipher_walk API usage
    
    When asked to encrypt or decrypt 0 bytes, both the generic and x86
    implementations of Salsa20 crash in blkcipher_walk_done(), either when
    doing 'kfree(walk->buffer)' or 'free_page((unsigned long)walk->page)',
    because walk->buffer and walk->page have not been initialized.
    
    The bug is that Salsa20 is calling blkcipher_walk_done() even when
    nothing is in 'walk.nbytes'.  But blkcipher_walk_done() is only meant to
    be called when a nonzero number of bytes have been provided.
    
    The broken code is part of an optimization that tries to make only one
    call to salsa20_encrypt_bytes() to process inputs that are not evenly
    divisible by 64 bytes.  To fix the bug, just remove this "optimization"
    and use the blkcipher_walk API the same way all the other users do.
    
    Reproducer:
    
        #include <linux/if_alg.h>
        #include <sys/socket.h>
        #include <unistd.h>
    
        int main()
        {

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit af3ff8045bbf3e32f1a448542e73abb4c8ceb6f1
Author: Eric Biggers <ebiggers@google.com>
Date:   Tue Nov 28 18:01:38 2017 -0800

    crypto: hmac - require that the underlying hash algorithm is unkeyed
    
    Because the HMAC template didn't check that its underlying hash
    algorithm is unkeyed, trying to use "hmac(hmac(sha3-512-generic))"
    through AF_ALG or through KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE resulted in the inner HMAC
    being used without having been keyed, resulting in sha3_update() being
    called without sha3_init(), causing a stack buffer overflow.
    
    This is a very old bug, but it seems to have only started causing real
    problems when SHA-3 support was added (requires CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA3)
    because the innermost hash's state is ->import()ed from a zeroed buffer,
    and it just so happens that other hash algorithms are fine with that,
    but SHA-3 is not.  However, there could be arch or hardware-dependent
    hash algorithms also affected; I couldn't test everything.
    
    Fix the bug by introducing a function crypto_shash_alg_has_setkey()
    which tests whether a shash algorithm is keyed.  Then update the HMAC
    template to require that its underlying hash algorithm is unkeyed.
    
    Here is a reproducer:
    
        #include <linux/if_alg.h>
        #include <sys/socket.h>
    
        int main()
        {
            int algfd;
            struct sockaddr_alg addr = {
                .salg_type = "hash",
                .salg_name = "hmac(hmac(sha3-512-generic))",
            };
            char key[4096] = { 0 };
    
            algfd = socket(AF_ALG, SOCK_SEQPACKET, 0);
            bind(algfd, (const struct sockaddr *)&addr, sizeof(addr));
            setsockopt(algfd, SOL_ALG, ALG_SET_KEY, key, sizeof(key));

commit 4dca6ea1d9432052afb06baf2e3ae78188a4410b

    KEYS: add missing permission check for request_key() destination
    
    When the request_key() syscall is not passed a destination keyring, it
    links the requested key (if constructed) into the "default" request-key
    keyring.  This should require Write permission to the keyring.  However,
    there is actually no permission check.
    
    This can be abused to add keys to any keyring to which only Search
    permission is granted.  This is because Search permission allows joining
    the keyring.  keyctl_set_reqkey_keyring(KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_SESSION_KEYRING)
    then will set the default request-key keyring to the session keyring.
    Then, request_key() can be used to add keys to the keyring.
    
    Both negatively and positively instantiated keys can be added using this
    method.  Adding negative keys is trivial.  Adding a positive key is a
    bit trickier.  It requires that either /sbin/request-key positively
    instantiates the key, or that another thread adds the key to the process
    keyring at just the right time, such that request_key() misses it
    initially but then finds it in construct_alloc_key().
    
    Fix this bug by checking for Write permission to the keyring in
    construct_get_dest_keyring() when the default keyring is being used.
    
    We don't do the permission check for non-default keyrings because that
    was already done by the earlier call to lookup_user_key().  Also,
    request_key_and_link() is currently passed a 'struct key *' rather than
    a key_ref_t, so the "possessed" bit is unavailable.
    
    We also don't do the permission check for the "requestor keyring", to
    continue to support the use case described by commit 8bbf4976b59f
    ("KEYS: Alter use of key instantiation link-to-keyring argument") where
    /sbin/request-key recursively calls request_key() to add keys to the
    original requestor's destination keyring.  (I don't know of any users
    who actually do that, though...)

    bpf: fix branch pruning logic
    
    when the verifier detects that register contains a runtime constant
    and it's compared with another constant it will prune exploration
    of the branch that is guaranteed not to be taken at runtime.
    This is all correct, but malicious program may be constructed
    in such a way that it always has a constant comparison and
    the other branch is never taken under any conditions.
    In this case such path through the program will not be explored
    by the verifier. It won't be taken at run-time either, but since
    all instructions are JITed the malicious program may cause JITs
    to complain about using reserved fields, etc.
    To fix the issue we have to track the instructions explored by
    the verifier and sanitize instructions that are dead at run time
    with NOPs. We cannot reject such dead code, since llvm generates
    it for valid C code, since it doesn't do as much data flow
    analysis as the verifier does.

    KVM: x86: fix emulation of "MOV SS, null selector"
    
    This is CVE-2017-2583.  On Intel this causes a failed vmentry because
    SS's type is neither 3 nor 7 (even though the manual says this check is
    only done for usable SS, and the dmesg splat says that SS is unusable!).
    On AMD it's worse: svm.c is confused and sets CPL to 0 in the vmcb.
    
    The fix fabricates a data segment descriptor when SS is set to a null
    selector, so that CPL and SS.DPL are set correctly in the VMCS/vmcb.
    Furthermore, only allow setting SS to a NULL selector if SS.RPL < 3;
    this in turn ensures CPL < 3 because RPL must be equal to CPL.
    
    Thanks to Andy Lutomirski and Willy Tarreau for help in analyzing
    the bug and deciphering the manuals.

    selinux: fix off-by-one in setprocattr
    
    SELinux tries to support setting/clearing of /proc/pid/attr attributes
    from the shell by ignoring terminating newlines and treating an
    attribute value that begins with a NUL or newline as an attempt to
    clear the attribute.  However, the test for clearing attributes has
    always been wrong; it has an off-by-one error, and this could further
    lead to reading past the end of the allocated buffer since commit
    bb646cdb12e75d82258c2f2e7746d5952d3e321a ("proc_pid_attr_write():
    switch to memdup_user()").  Fix the off-by-one error.
    
    Even with this fix, setting and clearing /proc/pid/attr attributes
    from the shell is not straightforward since the interface does not
    support multiple write() calls (so shells that write the value and
    newline separately will set and then immediately clear the attribute,
    requiring use of echo -n to set the attribute), whereas trying to use
    echo -n "" to clear the attribute causes the shell to skip the
    write() call altogether since POSIX says that a zero-length write
    causes no side effects. Thus, one must use echo -n to set and echo
    without -n to clear, as in the following example:
    $ echo -n unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 > /proc/$$/attr/fscreate
    $ cat /proc/$$/attr/fscreate
    unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0
    $ echo "" > /proc/$$/attr/fscreate
    $ cat /proc/$$/attr/fscreate
    
    Note the use of /proc/$$ rather than /proc/self, as otherwise
    the cat command will read its own attribute value, not that of the shell.
    
    There are no users of this facility to my knowledge; possibly we
    should just get rid of it.
    
    UPDATE: Upon further investigation it appears that a local process
    with the process:setfscreate permission can cause a kernel panic as a
    result of this bug.  This patch fixes CVE-2017-2618.

    tty: n_hdlc: get rid of racy n_hdlc.tbuf
    
    Currently N_HDLC line discipline uses a self-made singly linked list for
    data buffers and has n_hdlc.tbuf pointer for buffer retransmitting after
    an error.
    
    The commit be10eb7589337e5defbe214dae038a53dd21add8
    ("tty: n_hdlc add buffer flushing") introduced racy access to n_hdlc.tbuf.
    After tx error concurrent flush_tx_queue() and n_hdlc_send_frames() can put
    one data buffer to tx_free_buf_list twice. That causes double free in
    n_hdlc_release().
    
    Let's use standard kernel linked list and get rid of n_hdlc.tbuf:
    in case of tx error put current data buffer after the head of tx_buf_list.

    fix a fencepost error in pipe_advance()
    
    The logics in pipe_advance() used to release all buffers past the new
    position failed in cases when the number of buffers to release was equal
    to pipe->buffers.  If that happened, none of them had been released,
    leaving pipe full.  Worse, it was trivial to trigger and we end up with
    pipe full of uninitialized pages.  IOW, it's an infoleak.

    drm/vc4: Fix an integer overflow in temporary allocation layout.
    
    We copy the unvalidated ioctl arguments from the user into kernel
    temporary memory to run the validation from, to avoid a race where the
    user updates the unvalidate contents in between validating them and
    copying them into the validated BO.
    
    However, in setting up the layout of the kernel side, we failed to
    check one of the additions (the roundup() for shader_rec_offset)
    against integer overflow, allowing a nearly MAX_UINT value of
    bin_cl_size to cause us to under-allocate the temporary space that we
    then copy_from_user into.

    ipc/shm: Fix shmat mmap nil-page protection
    
    The issue is described here, with a nice testcase:
    
        https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=192931
    
    The problem is that shmat() calls do_mmap_pgoff() with MAP_FIXED, and
    the address rounded down to 0.  For the regular mmap case, the
    protection mentioned above is that the kernel gets to generate the
    address -- arch_get_unmapped_area() will always check for MAP_FIXED and
    return that address.  So by the time we do security_mmap_addr(0) things
    get funky for shmat().
    
    The testcase itself shows that while a regular user crashes, root will
    not have a problem attaching a nil-page.  There are two possible fixes
    to this.  The first, and which this patch does, is to simply allow root
    to crash as well -- this is also regular mmap behavior, ie when hacking
    up the testcase and adding mmap(...  |MAP_FIXED).  While this approach
    is the safer option, the second alternative is to ignore SHM_RND if the
    rounded address is 0, thus only having MAP_SHARED flags.  This makes the
    behavior of shmat() identical to the mmap() case.  The downside of this
    is obviously user visible, but does make sense in that it maintains
    semantics after the round-down wrt 0 address and mmap.
    
    Passes shm related ltp tests.

    Alexander Popov reported that an application may trigger a BUG_ON in
    sctp_wait_for_sndbuf if the socket tx buffer is full, a thread is
    waiting on it to queue more data and meanwhile another thread peels off
    the association being used by the first thread.
    
    This patch replaces the BUG_ON call with a proper error handling. It
    will return -EPIPE to the original sendmsg call, similarly to what would
    have been done if the association wasn't found in the first place.

    perf/core: Fix concurrent sys_perf_event_open() vs. 'move_group' race
    
    Di Shen reported a race between two concurrent sys_perf_event_open()
    calls where both try and move the same pre-existing software group
    into a hardware context.
    
    The problem is exactly that described in commit:
    
      f63a8daa5812 ("perf: Fix event->ctx locking")
    
    ... where, while we wait for a ctx->mutex acquisition, the event->ctx
    relation can have changed under us.
    
    That very same commit failed to recognise sys_perf_event_context() as an
    external access vector to the events and thereby didn't apply the
    established locking rules correctly.
    
    So while one sys_perf_event_open() call is stuck waiting on
    mutex_lock_double(), the other (which owns said locks) moves the group
    about. So by the time the former sys_perf_event_open() acquires the
    locks, the context we've acquired is stale (and possibly dead).
    
    Apply the established locking rules as per perf_event_ctx_lock_nested()
    to the mutex_lock_double() for the 'move_group' case. This obviously means
    we need to validate state after we acquire the locks.

    dccp: fix freeing skb too early for IPV6_RECVPKTINFO
    
    In the current DCCP implementation an skb for a DCCP_PKT_REQUEST packet
    is forcibly freed via __kfree_skb in dccp_rcv_state_process if
    dccp_v6_conn_request successfully returns.
    
    However, if IPV6_RECVPKTINFO is set on a socket, the address of the skb
    is saved to ireq->pktopts and the ref count for skb is incremented in
    dccp_v6_conn_request, so skb is still in use. Nevertheless, it gets freed
    in dccp_rcv_state_process.
    
    Fix by calling consume_skb instead of doing goto discard and therefore
    calling __kfree_skb.
    
    Similar fixes for TCP:

    __tcp_splice_read() returns 0, and sk_wait_data() immediately
    returns since there is the problematic skb in queue.

    sctp: deny peeloff operation on asocs with threads sleeping on it
    
    commit 2dcab5984841 ("sctp: avoid BUG_ON on sctp_wait_for_sndbuf")
    attempted to avoid a BUG_ON call when the association being used for a
    sendmsg() is blocked waiting for more sndbuf and another thread did a
    peeloff operation on such asoc, moving it to another socket.
    
    As Ben Hutchings noticed, then in such case it would return without
    locking back the socket and would cause two unlocks in a row.
    
    Further analysis also revealed that it could allow a double free if the
    application managed to peeloff the asoc that is created during the
    sendmsg call, because then sctp_sendmsg() would try to free the asoc
    that was created only for that call.
    
    This patch takes another approach. It will deny the peeloff operation
    if there is a thread sleeping on the asoc, so this situation doesn't
    exist anymore. This avoids the issues described above and also honors
    the syscalls that are already being handled (it can be multiple sendmsg
    calls).
    
    Joint work with Xin Long.

    ucount: Remove the atomicity from ucount->count
    
    Always increment/decrement ucount->count under the ucounts_lock.  The
    increments are there already and moving the decrements there means the
    locking logic of the code is simpler.  This simplification in the
    locking logic fixes a race between put_ucounts and get_ucounts that
    could result in a use-after-free because the count could go zero then
    be found by get_ucounts and then be freed by put_ucounts.
    
    A bug presumably this one was found by a combination of syzkaller and
    KASAN.  JongWhan Kim reported the syzkaller failure and Dmitry Vyukov
    spotted the race in the code.

    xfrm_user: validate XFRM_MSG_NEWAE XFRMA_REPLAY_ESN_VAL replay_window
    
    When a new xfrm state is created during an XFRM_MSG_NEWSA call we
    validate the user supplied replay_esn to ensure that the size is valid
    and to ensure that the replay_window size is within the allocated
    buffer.  However later it is possible to update this replay_esn via a
    XFRM_MSG_NEWAE call.  There we again validate the size of the supplied
    buffer matches the existing state and if so inject the contents.  We do
    not at this point check that the replay_window is within the allocated
    memory.  This leads to out-of-bounds reads and writes triggered by
    netlink packets.  This leads to memory corruption and the potential for
    priviledge escalation.
    
    We already attempt to validate the incoming replay information in
    xfrm_new_ae() via xfrm_replay_verify_len().  This confirms that the user
    is not trying to change the size of the replay state buffer which
    includes the replay_esn.  It however does not check the replay_window
    remains within that buffer.  Add validation of the contained
    replay_window.

    drm/vmwgfx: fix integer overflow in vmw_surface_define_ioctl()
    
    In vmw_surface_define_ioctl(), the 'num_sizes' is the sum of the
    'req->mip_levels' array. This array can be assigned any value from
    the user space. As both the 'num_sizes' and the array is uint32_t,
    it is easy to make 'num_sizes' overflow. The later 'mip_levels' is
    used as the loop count. This can lead an oob write. Add the check of
    'req->mip_levels' to avoid this.

    fscrypt: remove broken support for detecting keyring key revocation
    
    Filesystem encryption ostensibly supported revoking a keyring key that
    had been used to "unlock" encrypted files, causing those files to become
    "locked" again.  This was, however, buggy for several reasons, the most
    severe of which was that when key revocation happened to be detected for
    an inode, its fscrypt_info was immediately freed, even while other
    threads could be using it for encryption or decryption concurrently.
    This could be exploited to crash the kernel or worse.
    
    This patch fixes the use-after-free by removing the code which detects
    the keyring key having been revoked, invalidated, or expired.  Instead,
    an encrypted inode that is "unlocked" now simply remains unlocked until
    it is evicted from memory.  Note that this is no worse than the case for
    block device-level encryption, e.g. dm-crypt, and it still remains
    possible for a privileged user to evict unused pages, inodes, and
    dentries by running 'sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches', or by
    simply unmounting the filesystem.  In fact, one of those actions was
    already needed anyway for key revocation to work even somewhat sanely.
    This change is not expected to break any applications.
    
    In the future I'd like to implement a real API for fscrypt key
    revocation that interacts sanely with ongoing filesystem operations ---
    waiting for existing operations to complete and blocking new operations,
    and invalidating and sanitizing key material and plaintext from the VFS
    caches.  But this is a hard problem, and for now this bug must be fixed.
    
    This bug affected almost all versions of ext4, f2fs, and ubifs
    encryption, and it was potentially reachable in any kernel configured
    with encryption support (CONFIG_EXT4_ENCRYPTION=y,
    CONFIG_EXT4_FS_ENCRYPTION=y, CONFIG_F2FS_FS_ENCRYPTION=y, or
    CONFIG_UBIFS_FS_ENCRYPTION=y).  Note that older kernels did not use the
    shared fs/crypto/ code, but due to the potential security implications
    of this bug, it may still be worthwhile to backport this fix to them.

    KEYS: fix keyctl_set_reqkey_keyring() to not leak thread keyrings
    
    This fixes CVE-2017-7472.
    
    Running the following program as an unprivileged user exhausts kernel

    	{
    		for (;;)

    	}
    
    Fix it by only creating a new thread keyring if there wasn't one before.
    To make things more consistent, make install_thread_keyring_to_cred()
    and install_process_keyring_to_cred() both return 0 if the corresponding
    keyring is already present.

    macsec: avoid heap overflow in skb_to_sgvec
    
    While this may appear as a humdrum one line change, it's actually quite
    important. An sk_buff stores data in three places:
    
    1. A linear chunk of allocated memory in skb->data. This is the easiest
       one to work with, but it precludes using scatterdata since the memory
       must be linear.
    2. The array skb_shinfo(skb)->frags, which is of maximum length
       MAX_SKB_FRAGS. This is nice for scattergather, since these fragments
       can point to different pages.
    3. skb_shinfo(skb)->frag_list, which is a pointer to another sk_buff,
       which in turn can have data in either (1) or (2).
    
    The first two are rather easy to deal with, since they're of a fixed
    maximum length, while the third one is not, since there can be
    potentially limitless chains of fragments. Fortunately dealing with
    frag_list is opt-in for drivers, so drivers don't actually have to deal
    with this mess. For whatever reason, macsec decided it wanted pain, and
    so it explicitly specified NETIF_F_FRAGLIST.
    
    Because dealing with (1), (2), and (3) is insane, most users of sk_buff
    doing any sort of crypto or paging operation calls a convenient function
    called skb_to_sgvec (which happens to be recursive if (3) is in use!).
    This takes a sk_buff as input, and writes into its output pointer an
    array of scattergather list items. Sometimes people like to declare a
    fixed size scattergather list on the stack; othertimes people like to
    allocate a fixed size scattergather list on the heap. However, if you're
    doing it in a fixed-size fashion, you really shouldn't be using
    NETIF_F_FRAGLIST too (unless you're also ensuring the sk_buff and its
    frag_list children arent't shared and then you check the number of
    fragments in total required.)
    
    Macsec specifically does this:
    
            size += sizeof(struct scatterlist) * (MAX_SKB_FRAGS + 1);
            tmp = kmalloc(size, GFP_ATOMIC);
            *sg = (struct scatterlist *)(tmp + sg_offset);
    	...
            sg_init_table(sg, MAX_SKB_FRAGS + 1);
            skb_to_sgvec(skb, sg, 0, skb->len);
    
    Specifying MAX_SKB_FRAGS + 1 is the right answer usually, but not if you're
    using NETIF_F_FRAGLIST, in which case the call to skb_to_sgvec will
    overflow the heap, and disaster ensues.

    modify the skb as such (another error from prior). Now that we have the
    number of fragments required, we can safely allocate exactly that amount
    of memory.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 5f2f97656ada8d811d3c1bef503ced266fcd53a0
Author: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>
Date:   Thu Jun 15 00:12:24 2017 +0100

    rxrpc: Fix several cases where a padded len isn't checked in ticket decode
    
    This fixes CVE-2017-7482.
    
    When a kerberos 5 ticket is being decoded so that it can be loaded into an
    rxrpc-type key, there are several places in which the length of a
    variable-length field is checked to make sure that it's not going to
    overrun the available data - but the data is padded to the nearest
    four-byte boundary and the code doesn't check for this extra.  This could
    lead to the size-remaining variable wrapping and the data pointer going
    over the end of the buffer.
    
    Fix this by making the various variable-length data checks use the padded
    length.

    KVM: x86: fix singlestepping over syscall
    
    TF is handled a bit differently for syscall and sysret, compared
    to the other instructions: TF is checked after the instruction completes,
    so that the OS can disable #DB at a syscall by adding TF to FMASK.
    When the sysret is executed the #DB is taken "as if" the syscall insn
    just completed.
    
    KVM emulates syscall so that it can trap 32-bit syscall on Intel processors.
    Fix the behavior, otherwise you could get #DB on a user stack which is not
    nice.  This does not affect Linux guests, as they use an IST or task gate
    for #DB.
    
    This fixes CVE-2017-7518.

    dentry name snapshots
    
    take_dentry_name_snapshot() takes a safe snapshot of dentry name;
    if the name is a short one, it gets copied into caller-supplied
    structure, otherwise an extra reference to external name is grabbed
    (those are never modified).  In either case the pointer to stable
    string is stored into the same structure.
    
    dentry must be held by the caller of take_dentry_name_snapshot(),
    but may be freely dropped afterwards - the snapshot will stay
    until destroyed by release_dentry_name_snapshot().
    
    Intended use:
    	struct name_snapshot s;
    
    	take_dentry_name_snapshot(&s, dentry);
    	...
    	access s.name
    	...
    	release_dentry_name_snapshot(&s);
    
    Replaces fsnotify_oldname_...(), gets used in fsnotify to obtain the name
    to pass down with event.

    brcmfmac: fix possible buffer overflow in brcmf_cfg80211_mgmt_tx()
    
    The lower level nl80211 code in cfg80211 ensures that "len" is between
    25 and NL80211_ATTR_FRAME (2304).  We subtract DOT11_MGMT_HDR_LEN (24) from
    "len" so thats's max of 2280.  However, the action_frame->data[] buffer is
    only BRCMF_FIL_ACTION_FRAME_SIZE (1800) bytes long so this memcpy() can
    overflow.
    
    	memcpy(action_frame->data, &buf[DOT11_MGMT_HDR_LEN],
    	       le16_to_cpu(action_frame->len));

    ipv6: avoid overflow of offset in ip6_find_1stfragopt
    
    In some cases, offset can overflow and can cause an infinite loop in
    ip6_find_1stfragopt(). Make it unsigned int to prevent the overflow, and
    cap it at IPV6_MAXPLEN, since packets larger than that should be invalid.
    
    This problem has been here since before the beginning of git history.

    sctp: Avoid out-of-bounds reads from address storage
    
    inet_diag_msg_sctp{,l}addr_fill() and sctp_get_sctp_info() copy
    sizeof(sockaddr_storage) bytes to fill in sockaddr structs used
    to export diagnostic information to userspace.
    
    However, the memory allocated to store sockaddr information is
    smaller than that and depends on the address family, so we leak
    up to 100 uninitialized bytes to userspace. Just use the size of
    the source structs instead, in all the three cases this is what
    userspace expects. Zero out the remaining memory.
    
    Unused bytes (i.e. when IPv4 addresses are used) in source
    structs sctp_sockaddr_entry and sctp_transport are already
    cleared by sctp_add_bind_addr() and sctp_transport_new(),
    respectively.

    crypto: ahash - Fix EINPROGRESS notification callback
    
    The ahash API modifies the request's callback function in order
    to clean up after itself in some corner cases (unaligned final
    and missing finup).
    
    When the request is complete ahash will restore the original
    callback and everything is fine.  However, when the request gets
    an EBUSY on a full queue, an EINPROGRESS callback is made while
    the request is still ongoing.
    
    In this case the ahash API will incorrectly call its own callback.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by creating a temporary request
    object on the stack which is used to relay EINPROGRESS back to
    the original completion function.
    
    This patch also adds code to preserve the original flags value.

    nfsd: stricter decoding of write-like NFSv2/v3 ops
    
    The NFSv2/v3 code does not systematically check whether we decode past

    are a few places where we do arithmetic on the pointers involved and
    don't account for the possibility that a length could be negative.  Add

    nfsd: check for oversized NFSv2/v3 arguments
    
    A client can append random data to the end of an NFSv2 or NFSv3 RPC call
    without our complaining; we'll just stop parsing at the end of the
    expected data and ignore the rest.
    
    Encoded arguments and replies are stored together in an array of pages,
    and if a call is too large it could leave inadequate space for the
    reply.  This is normally OK because NFS RPC's typically have either
    short arguments and long replies (like READ) or long arguments and short
    replies (like WRITE).  But a client that sends an incorrectly long reply
    can violate those assumptions.  This was observed to cause crashes.
    
    Also, several operations increment rq_next_page in the decode routine
    before checking the argument size, which can leave rq_next_page pointing
    well past the end of the page array, causing trouble later in
    svc_free_pages.
    
    So, following a suggestion from Neil Brown, add a central check to
    enforce our expectation that no NFSv2/v3 call has both a large call and
    a large reply.
    
    As followup we may also want to rewrite the encoding routines to check
    more carefully that they aren't running off the end of the page array.
    
    We may also consider rejecting calls that have any extra garbage
    appended.  That would be safer, and within our rights by spec, but given
    the age of our server and the NFS protocol, and the fact that we've
    never enforced this before, we may need to balance that against the
    possibility of breaking some oddball client.

    mm: Tighten x86 /dev/mem with zeroing reads
    
    Under CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM, reading System RAM through /dev/mem is
    disallowed. However, on x86, the first 1MB was always allowed for BIOS
    and similar things, regardless of it actually being System RAM. It was
    possible for heap to end up getting allocated in low 1MB RAM, and then
    read by things like x86info or dd, which would trip hardened usercopy:
    
    usercopy: kernel memory exposure attempt detected from ffff880000090000 (dma-kmalloc-256) (4096 bytes)
    
    This changes the x86 exception for the low 1MB by reading back zeros for
    System RAM areas instead of blindly allowing them. More work is needed to
    extend this to mmap, but currently mmap doesn't go through usercopy, so
    hardened usercopy won't Oops the kernel.

    [media] dw2102: don't do DMA on stack
    
    On Kernel 4.9, WARNINGs about doing DMA on stack are hit at
    the dw2102 driver: one in su3000_power_ctrl() and the other in tt_s2_4600_frontend_attach().
    
    Both were due to the use of buffers on the stack as parameters to
    dvb_usb_generic_rw() and the resulting attempt to do DMA with them.
    
    The device was non-functional as a result.
    
    So, switch this driver over to use a buffer within the device state
    structure, as has been done with other DVB-USB drivers.
    
    Tested with TechnoTrend TT-connect S2-4600.

    added a kmalloc'ed bounce buffer for writes, but missed to do the same
    for reads. As the read only happens after the write is finished, we can
    reuse the same buffer.
    
    As dvb_usb_generic_rw handles a read length of 0 by itself, avoid calling

    [media] dvb-usb-v2: avoid use-after-free
    
    I ran into a stack frame size warning because of the on-stack copy of
    the USB device structure:
    
    drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb-v2/dvb_usb_core.c: In function 'dvb_usbv2_disconnect':
    drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb-v2/dvb_usb_core.c:1029:1: error: the frame size of 1104 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]
    
    Copying a device structure like this is wrong for a number of other reasons
    too aside from the possible stack overflow. One of them is that the
    dev_info() call will print the name of the device later, but AFAICT
    we have only copied a pointer to the name earlier and the actual name
    has been freed by the time it gets printed.
    
    This removes the on-stack copy of the device and instead copies the
    device name using kstrdup(). I'm ignoring the possible failure here
    as both printk() and kfree() are able to deal with NULL pointers.

    callbacks can sleep. Fix this up by replacing the spinlock with a mutex.

    nfsd: fix undefined behavior in nfsd4_layout_verify
    
      UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in fs/nfsd/nfs4proc.c:1262:34
      shift exponent 128 is too large for 32-bit type 'int'
    
    Depending on compiler+architecture, this may cause the check for
    layout_type to succeed for overly large values (which seems to be the
    case with amd64). The large value will be later used in de-referencing
    nfsd4_layout_ops for function pointers.

    nfsd: encoders mustn't use unitialized values in error cases
    
    In error cases, lgp->lg_layout_type may be out of bounds; so we
    shouldn't be using it until after the check of nfserr.
    
    This was seen to crash nfsd threads when the server receives a LAYOUTGET
    request with a large layout type.
    
    GETDEVICEINFO has the same problem.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 2423496af35d94a87156b063ea5cedffc10a70a1
Author: Craig Gallek <kraig@google.com>
Date:   Tue May 16 14:36:23 2017 -0400

    ipv6: Prevent overrun when parsing v6 header options
    
    The KASAN warning repoted below was discovered with a syzkaller
    program.  The reproducer is basically:
      int s = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_RAW, NEXTHDR_HOP);
      send(s, &one_byte_of_data, 1, MSG_MORE);
      send(s, &more_than_mtu_bytes_data, 2000, 0);
    
    The socket() call sets the nexthdr field of the v6 header to
    NEXTHDR_HOP, the first send call primes the payload with a non zero
    byte of data, and the second send call triggers the fragmentation path.
    
    The fragmentation code tries to parse the header options in order
    to figure out where to insert the fragment option.  Since nexthdr points
    to an invalid option, the calculation of the size of the network header
    can made to be much larger than the linear section of the skb and data
    is read outside of it.
    
    This fix makes ip6_find_1stfrag return an error if it detects
    running out-of-bounds.

    bpf: don't let ldimm64 leak map addresses on unprivileged
    
    The patch fixes two things at once:
    
    1) It checks the env->allow_ptr_leaks and only prints the map address to
       the log if we have the privileges to do so, otherwise it just dumps 0
       as we would when kptr_restrict is enabled on %pK. Given the latter is
       off by default and not every distro sets it, I don't want to rely on
       this, hence the 0 by default for unprivileged.
    
    2) Printing of ldimm64 in the verifier log is currently broken in that
       we don't print the full immediate, but only the 32 bit part of the
       first insn part for ldimm64. Thus, fix this up as well; it's okay to
       access, since we verified all ldimm64 earlier already (including just
       constants) through replace_map_fd_with_map_ptr().

    ipv6: fix out of bound writes in __ip6_append_data()
    
    Andrey Konovalov and idaifish@gmail.com reported crashes caused by
    one skb shared_info being overwritten from __ip6_append_data()
    
    Andrey program lead to following state :
    
    copy -4200 datalen 2000 fraglen 2040
    maxfraglen 2040 alloclen 2048 transhdrlen 0 offset 0 fraggap 6200
    
    The skb_copy_and_csum_bits(skb_prev, maxfraglen, data + transhdrlen,
    fraggap, 0); is overwriting skb->head and skb_shared_info
    
    Since we apparently detect this rare condition too late, move the
    code earlier to even avoid allocating skb and risking crashes.
    
    Once again, many thanks to Andrey and syzkaller team.

    drm/vmwgfx: Make sure backup_handle is always valid
    
    When vmw_gb_surface_define_ioctl() is called with an existing buffer,
    we end up returning an uninitialized variable in the backup_handle.
    
    The fix is to first initialize backup_handle to 0 just to be sure, and
    second, when a user-provided buffer is found, we will use the
    req->buffer_handle as the backup_handle.
