Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 98da7d08850fb8bdeb395d6368ed15753304aa0c
Author: Kees Cook <keescook@chromium.org>
Date:   Fri Jun 23 15:08:57 2017 -0700

    fs/exec.c: account for argv/envp pointers
    
    When limiting the argv/envp strings during exec to 1/4 of the stack limit,
    the storage of the pointers to the strings was not included.  This means
    that an exec with huge numbers of tiny strings could eat 1/4 of the stack
    limit in strings and then additional space would be later used by the
    pointers to the strings.
    
    For example, on 32-bit with a 8MB stack rlimit, an exec with 1677721
    single-byte strings would consume less than 2MB of stack, the max (8MB /
    4) amount allowed, but the pointers to the strings would consume the
    remaining additional stack space (1677721 * 4 == 6710884).
    
    The result (1677721 + 6710884 == 8388605) would exhaust stack space
    entirely.  Controlling this stack exhaustion could result in
    pathological behavior in setuid binaries (CVE-2017-1000365).

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 5f2f97656ada8d811d3c1bef503ced266fcd53a0
Author: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>
Date:   Thu Jun 15 00:12:24 2017 +0100

    rxrpc: Fix several cases where a padded len isn't checked in ticket decode
    
    This fixes CVE-2017-7482.
    
    When a kerberos 5 ticket is being decoded so that it can be loaded into an
    rxrpc-type key, there are several places in which the length of a
    variable-length field is checked to make sure that it's not going to
    overrun the available data - but the data is padded to the nearest
    four-byte boundary and the code doesn't check for this extra.  This could
    lead to the size-remaining variable wrapping and the data pointer going
    over the end of the buffer.
    
    Fix this by making the various variable-length data checks use the padded
    length.
