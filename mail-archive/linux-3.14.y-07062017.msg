Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit e0c9c0afd2fc958ffa34b697972721d81df8a56f

    mnt: Update detach_mounts to leave mounts connected
    
    Now that it is possible to lazily unmount an entire mount tree and
    leave the individual mounts connected to each other add a new flag
    UMOUNT_CONNECTED to umount_tree to force this behavior and use
    this flag in detach_mounts.
    
    This closes a bug where the deletion of a file or directory could
    trigger an unmount and reveal data under a mount point.

    ovl: do operations on underlying file system in mounter's context
    
    Given we are now doing checks both on overlay inode as well underlying
    inode, we should be able to do checks and operations on underlying file
    system using mounter's context.
    
    So modify all operations to do checks/operations on underlying dentry/inode
    in the context of mounter.
