Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 13bf9fbff0e5e099e2b6f003a0ab8ae145436309
Author: J. Bruce Fields <bfields@redhat.com>
Date:   Fri Apr 21 15:26:30 2017 -0400

    nfsd: stricter decoding of write-like NFSv2/v3 ops
    
    The NFSv2/v3 code does not systematically check whether we decode past
    the end of the buffer.  This generally appears to be harmless, but there
    are a few places where we do arithmetic on the pointers involved and
    don't account for the possibility that a length could be negative.  Add
    checks to catch these.
