    KVM: x86: SYSENTER emulation is broken
    
    SYSENTER emulation is broken in several ways:
    1. It misses the case of 16-bit code segments completely (CVE-2015-0239).
    2. MSR_IA32_SYSENTER_CS is checked in 64-bit mode incorrectly (bits 0 and 1 can
       still be set without causing #GP).
    3. MSR_IA32_SYSENTER_EIP and MSR_IA32_SYSENTER_ESP are not masked in
       legacy-mode.
    4. There is some unneeded code.
    
    Fix it.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 77751427a1ff25b27d47a4c36b12c3c8667855ac
Author: Marcelo Leitner <mleitner@redhat.com>
Date:   Mon Feb 23 11:17:13 2015 -0300

    ipv6: addrconf: validate new MTU before applying it
    
    Currently we don't check if the new MTU is valid or not and this allows
    one to configure a smaller than minimum allowed by RFCs or even bigger
    than interface own MTU, which is a problem as it may lead to packet
    drops.
    
    If you have a daemon like NetworkManager running, this may be exploited
    by remote attackers by forging RA packets with an invalid MTU, possibly
    leading to a DoS. (NetworkManager currently only validates for values
    too small, but not for too big ones.)
    
    The fix is just to make sure the new value is valid. That is, between
    IPV6_MIN_MTU and interface's MTU.
    
    Note that similar check is already performed at
    ndisc_router_discovery(), for when kernel itself parses the RA.

    ext4: allocate entire range in zero range
    
    Currently there is a bug in zero range code which causes zero range
    calls to only allocate block aligned portion of the range, while
    ignoring the rest in some cases.
    
    In some cases, namely if the end of the range is past i_size, we do
    attempt to preallocate the last nonaligned block. However this might
    cause kernel to BUG() in some carefully designed zero range requests
    on setups where page size > block size.
    
    Fix this problem by first preallocating the entire range, including
    the nonaligned edges and converting the written extents to unwritten
    in the next step. This approach will also give us the advantage of
    having the range to be as linearly contiguous as possible.

    KEYS: ensure we free the assoc array edit if edit is valid
    
    __key_link_end is not freeing the associated array edit structure
    and this leads to a 512 byte memory leak each time an identical
    existing key is added with add_key().
    
    The reason the add_key() system call returns okay is that
    key_create_or_update() calls __key_link_begin() before checking to see
    whether it can update a key directly rather than adding/replacing - which
    it turns out it can.  Thus __key_link() is not called through
    __key_instantiate_and_link() and __key_link_end() must cancel the edit.

    vfs: read file_handle only once in handle_to_path
    
    We used to read file_handle twice.  Once to get the amount of extra
    bytes, and once to fetch the entire structure.
    
    This may be problematic since we do size verifications only after the
    first read, so if the number of extra bytes changes in userspace between
    the first and second calls, we'll have an incoherent view of
    file_handle.
    
    Instead, read the constant size once, and copy that over to the final
    structure without having to re-read it again.

    net: sctp: fix slab corruption from use after free on INIT collisions
    
    When hitting an INIT collision case during the 4WHS with AUTH enabled, as
    already described in detail in commit 1be9a950c646 ("net: sctp: inherit
    auth_capable on INIT collisions"), it can happen that we occasionally
    still remotely trigger the following panic on server side which seems to

    Since this only triggers in some collision-cases with AUTH, the problem at
    heart is that sctp_auth_key_put() on asoc->asoc_shared_key is called twice
    when having refcnt 1, once directly in sctp_assoc_update() and yet again
    from within sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key() via sctp_assoc_update() on
    the already kzfree'd memory, which is also consistent with the observation
    of the poison decrease from 0x6b to 0x6a (note: the overwrite is detected
    at a later point in time when poison is checked on new allocation).
    
    Reference counting of auth keys revisited:
    
    Shared keys for AUTH chunks are being stored in endpoints and associations
    in endpoint_shared_keys list. On endpoint creation, a null key is being
    added; on association creation, all endpoint shared keys are being cached
    and thus cloned over to the association. struct sctp_shared_key only holds
    a pointer to the actual key bytes, that is, struct sctp_auth_bytes which
    keeps track of users internally through refcounting. Naturally, on assoc
    or enpoint destruction, sctp_shared_key are being destroyed directly and
    the reference on sctp_auth_bytes dropped.
    
    User space can add keys to either list via setsockopt(2) through struct
    sctp_authkey and by passing that to sctp_auth_set_key() which replaces or
    adds a new auth key. There, sctp_auth_create_key() creates a new sctp_auth_bytes
    with refcount 1 and in case of replacement drops the reference on the old
    sctp_auth_bytes. A key can be set active from user space through setsockopt()
    on the id via sctp_auth_set_active_key(), which iterates through either
    endpoint_shared_keys and in case of an assoc, invokes (one of various places)
    sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key().
    
    sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key() computes the actual secret from local's
    and peer's random, hmac and shared key parameters and returns a new key
    directly as sctp_auth_bytes, that is asoc->asoc_shared_key, plus drops
    the reference if there was a previous one. The secret, which where we
    eventually double drop the ref comes from sctp_auth_asoc_set_secret() with
    intitial refcount of 1, which also stays unchanged eventually in
    sctp_assoc_update(). This key is later being used for crypto layer to
    set the key for the hash in crypto_hash_setkey() from sctp_auth_calculate_hmac().
    
    To close the loop: asoc->asoc_shared_key is freshly allocated secret
    material and independant of the sctp_shared_key management keeping track
    of only shared keys in endpoints and assocs. Hence, also commit 4184b2a79a76
    ("net: sctp: fix memory leak in auth key management") is independant of
    this bug here since it concerns a different layer (though same structures
    being used eventually). asoc->asoc_shared_key is reference dropped correctly
    on assoc destruction in sctp_association_free() and when active keys are
    being replaced in sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key(), it always has a refcount
    of 1. Hence, it's freed prematurely in sctp_assoc_update(). Simple fix is
    to remove that sctp_auth_key_put() from there which fixes these panics.

    The affected function is randomize_stack_top() in file
    "fs/binfmt_elf.c":
    
      static unsigned long randomize_stack_top(unsigned long stack_top)
      {
               unsigned int random_variable = 0;
    
               if ((current->flags & PF_RANDOMIZE) &&
                       !(current->personality & ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE)) {
                       random_variable = get_random_int() & STACK_RND_MASK;
                       random_variable <<= PAGE_SHIFT;
               }
               return PAGE_ALIGN(stack_top) + random_variable;
               return PAGE_ALIGN(stack_top) - random_variable;
      }
    
    Note that, it declares the "random_variable" variable as "unsigned int".
    Since the result of the shifting operation between STACK_RND_MASK (which
    is 0x3fffff on x86_64, 22 bits) and PAGE_SHIFT (which is 12 on x86_64):
    
    	  random_variable <<= PAGE_SHIFT;
    
    then the two leftmost bits are dropped when storing the result in the
    "random_variable". This variable shall be at least 34 bits long to hold
    the (22+12) result.
    
    These two dropped bits have an impact on the entropy of process stack.
    Concretely, the total stack entropy is reduced by four: from 2^28 to
    2^30 (One fourth of expected entropy).
    
    This patch restores back the entropy by correcting the types involved
    in the operations in the functions randomize_stack_top() and
    stack_maxrandom_size().
    
    The successful fix can be tested with:
    
      $ for i in `seq 1 10`; do cat /proc/self/maps | grep stack; done
      7ffeda566000-7ffeda587000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
      7fff5a332000-7fff5a353000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
      7ffcdb7a1000-7ffcdb7c2000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
      7ffd5e2c4000-7ffd5e2e5000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
      ...
    
    Once corrected, the leading bytes should be between 7ffc and 7fff,
    rather than always being 7fff.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 6b8d9117ccb4f81b1244aafa7bc70ef8fa45fc49
Author: Sasha Levin <sasha.levin@oracle.com>

    net: llc: use correct size for sysctl timeout entries
    
    The timeout entries are sizeof(int) rather than sizeof(long), which
    means that when they were getting read we'd also leak kernel memory
    to userspace along with the timeout values.
