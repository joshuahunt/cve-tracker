    ping: implement proper locking
    
    We got a report of yet another bug in ping
    
    http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/03/24/6
    
    ->disconnect() is not called with socket lock held.
    
    Fix this by acquiring ping rwlock earlier.

    net/packet: fix overflow in check for tp_frame_nr
    
    When calculating rb->frames_per_block * req->tp_block_nr the result
    can overflow.
    
    Add a check that tp_block_size * tp_block_nr <= UINT_MAX.
    
    Since frames_per_block <= tp_block_size, the expression would
    never overflow.

    macsec: avoid heap overflow in skb_to_sgvec
    
    While this may appear as a humdrum one line change, it's actually quite
    important. An sk_buff stores data in three places:
    
    1. A linear chunk of allocated memory in skb->data. This is the easiest
       one to work with, but it precludes using scatterdata since the memory
       must be linear.
    2. The array skb_shinfo(skb)->frags, which is of maximum length
       MAX_SKB_FRAGS. This is nice for scattergather, since these fragments
       can point to different pages.
    3. skb_shinfo(skb)->frag_list, which is a pointer to another sk_buff,
       which in turn can have data in either (1) or (2).
    
    The first two are rather easy to deal with, since they're of a fixed
    maximum length, while the third one is not, since there can be
    potentially limitless chains of fragments. Fortunately dealing with
    frag_list is opt-in for drivers, so drivers don't actually have to deal
    with this mess. For whatever reason, macsec decided it wanted pain, and
    so it explicitly specified NETIF_F_FRAGLIST.
    
    Because dealing with (1), (2), and (3) is insane, most users of sk_buff
    doing any sort of crypto or paging operation calls a convenient function
    called skb_to_sgvec (which happens to be recursive if (3) is in use!).
    This takes a sk_buff as input, and writes into its output pointer an
    array of scattergather list items. Sometimes people like to declare a
    fixed size scattergather list on the stack; othertimes people like to
    allocate a fixed size scattergather list on the heap. However, if you're
    doing it in a fixed-size fashion, you really shouldn't be using
    NETIF_F_FRAGLIST too (unless you're also ensuring the sk_buff and its
    frag_list children arent't shared and then you check the number of
    fragments in total required.)
    
    Macsec specifically does this:
    
            size += sizeof(struct scatterlist) * (MAX_SKB_FRAGS + 1);
            tmp = kmalloc(size, GFP_ATOMIC);
            *sg = (struct scatterlist *)(tmp + sg_offset);
    	...
            sg_init_table(sg, MAX_SKB_FRAGS + 1);
            skb_to_sgvec(skb, sg, 0, skb->len);
    
    Specifying MAX_SKB_FRAGS + 1 is the right answer usually, but not if you're
    using NETIF_F_FRAGLIST, in which case the call to skb_to_sgvec will
    overflow the heap, and disaster ensues.

    nfsd: stricter decoding of write-like NFSv2/v3 ops
    
    The NFSv2/v3 code does not systematically check whether we decode past
    the end of the buffer.  This generally appears to be harmless, but there
    are a few places where we do arithmetic on the pointers involved and
    don't account for the possibility that a length could be negative.  Add
    checks to catch these.

    nfsd: check for oversized NFSv2/v3 arguments
    
    A client can append random data to the end of an NFSv2 or NFSv3 RPC call
    without our complaining; we'll just stop parsing at the end of the
    expected data and ignore the rest.
    
    Encoded arguments and replies are stored together in an array of pages,
    and if a call is too large it could leave inadequate space for the
    reply.  This is normally OK because NFS RPC's typically have either
    short arguments and long replies (like READ) or long arguments and short
    replies (like WRITE).  But a client that sends an incorrectly long reply
    can violate those assumptions.  This was observed to cause crashes.
    
    Also, several operations increment rq_next_page in the decode routine
    before checking the argument size, which can leave rq_next_page pointing
    well past the end of the page array, causing trouble later in
    svc_free_pages.
    
    So, following a suggestion from Neil Brown, add a central check to
    enforce our expectation that no NFSv2/v3 call has both a large call and
    a large reply.
    
    As followup we may also want to rewrite the encoding routines to check
    more carefully that they aren't running off the end of the page array.
    
    We may also consider rejecting calls that have any extra garbage
    appended.  That would be safer, and within our rights by spec, but given
    the age of our server and the NFS protocol, and the fact that we've
    never enforced this before, we may need to balance that against the
    possibility of breaking some oddball client.
