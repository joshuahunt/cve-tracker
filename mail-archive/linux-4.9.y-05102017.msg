Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 3a8b0677fc6180a467e26cc32ce6b0c09a32f9bb
Author: Jan H. Schönherr <jschoenh@amazon.de>
Date:   Thu Sep 7 19:02:30 2017 +0100

    KVM: VMX: Do not BUG() on out-of-bounds guest IRQ
    
    The value of the guest_irq argument to vmx_update_pi_irte() is
    ultimately coming from a KVM_IRQFD API call. Do not BUG() in
    vmx_update_pi_irte() if the value is out-of bounds. (Especially,
    since KVM as a whole seems to hang after that.)
    
    Instead, print a message only once if we find that we don't have a
    route for a certain IRQ (which can be out-of-bounds or within the
    array).
    
    This fixes CVE-2017-1000252.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 51aa68e7d57e3217192d88ce90fd5b8ef29ec94f

    kvm: nVMX: Don't allow L2 to access the hardware CR8
    
    If L1 does not specify the "use TPR shadow" VM-execution control in
    vmcs12, then L0 must specify the "CR8-load exiting" and "CR8-store
    exiting" VM-execution controls in vmcs02. Failure to do so will give
    the L2 VM unrestricted read/write access to the hardware CR8.
    
    This fixes CVE-2017-12154.

    video: fbdev: aty: do not leak uninitialized padding in clk to userspace
    
    'clk' is copied to a userland with padding byte(s) after 'vclk_post_div'
    field unitialized, leaking data from the stack. Fix this ensuring all of
    'clk' is initialized to zero.
