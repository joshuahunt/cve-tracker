Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 7314e613d5ff9f0934f7a0f74ed7973b903315d1
Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>
Date:   Tue Oct 29 10:21:34 2013 -0700

    Fix a few incorrectly checked [io_]remap_pfn_range() calls
    
    Nico Golde reports a few straggling uses of [io_]remap_pfn_range() that
    really should use the vm_iomap_memory() helper.  This trivially converts
    two of them to the helper, and comments about why the third one really
    needs to continue to use remap_pfn_range(), and adds the missing size
    check.

    libertas: potential oops in debugfs
    
    If we do a zero size allocation then it will oops.  Also we can't be
    sure the user passes us a NUL terminated string so I've added a
    terminator.
    
    This code can only be triggered by root.

    aacraid: prevent invalid pointer dereference
    
    It appears that driver runs into a problem here if fibsize is too small
    because we allocate user_srbcmd with fibsize size only but later we
    access it until user_srbcmd->sg.count to copy it over to srbcmd.
    
    It is not correct to test (fibsize < sizeof(*user_srbcmd)) because this
    structure already includes one sg element and this is not needed for
    commands without data.  So, we would recommend to add the following
    (instead of test for fibsize == 0).
