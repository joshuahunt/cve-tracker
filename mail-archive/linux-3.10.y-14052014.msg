Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 5678de3f15010b9022ee45673f33bcfc71d47b60

    KVM: ioapic: fix assignment of ioapic->rtc_status.pending_eoi (CVE-2014-0155)
    
    QE reported that they got the BUG_ON in ioapic_service to trigger.
    I cannot reproduce it, but there are two reasons why this could happen.
    
    The less likely but also easiest one, is when kvm_irq_delivery_to_apic
    does not deliver to any APIC and returns -1.
    
    Because irqe.shorthand == 0, the kvm_for_each_vcpu loop in that
    function is never reached.  However, you can target the similar loop in
    kvm_irq_delivery_to_apic_fast; just program a zero logical destination
    address into the IOAPIC, or an out-of-range physical destination address.
