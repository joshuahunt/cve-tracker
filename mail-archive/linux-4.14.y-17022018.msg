    media: dvb-usb-v2: lmedm04: move ts2020 attach to dm04_lme2510_tuner
    
    When the tuner was split from m88rs2000 the attach function is in wrong
    place.

    media: hdpvr: Fix an error handling path in hdpvr_probe()
    
    Here, hdpvr_register_videodev() is responsible for setup and
    register a video device. Also defining and initializing a worker.
    hdpvr_register_videodev() is calling by hdpvr_probe at last.
    So no need to flush any work here.
    Unregister v4l2, free buffers and memory. If hdpvr_probe() will fail.

    ACPI: sbshc: remove raw pointer from printk() message
    
    There's no need to be printing a raw kernel pointer to the kernel log at
    every boot.  So just remove it, and change the whole message to use the
    correct dev_info() call at the same time.
