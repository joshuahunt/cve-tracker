Description of fix for this vulnerability:

    s390: fix kernel crash due to linkage stack instructions
    
    The kernel currently crashes with a low-address-protection exception
    if a user space process executes an instruction that tries to use the
    linkage stack. Set the base-ASTE origin and the subspace-ASTE origin
    of the dispatchable-unit-control-table to point to a dummy ASTE.
    Set up control register 15 to point to an empty linkage stack with no
    room left.
    
    A user space process with a linkage stack instruction will still crash
    but with a different exception which is correctly translated to a
    segmentation fault instead of a kernel oops.
