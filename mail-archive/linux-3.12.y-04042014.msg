Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit d558023207e008a4476a3b7bb8706b2a2bf5d84f

    aio: prevent double free in ioctx_alloc
    
    ioctx_alloc() calls aio_setup_ring() to allocate a ring. If aio_setup_ring()
    fails to do so it would call aio_free_ring() before returning, but
    ioctx_alloc() would call aio_free_ring() again causing a double free of
    the ring.
    
    This is easily reproducible from userspace.
