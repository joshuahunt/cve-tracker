Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 59c816c1f24df0204e01851431d3bab3eb76719c

    vhost/scsi: potential memory corruption
    
    This code in vhost_scsi_make_tpg() is confusing because we limit "tpgt"
    to UINT_MAX but the data type of "tpg->tport_tpgt" and that is a u16.
    
    I looked at the context and it turns out that in
    vhost_scsi_set_endpoint(), "tpg->tport_tpgt" is used as an offset into
    the vs_tpg[] array which has VHOST_SCSI_MAX_TARGET (256) elements so
    anything higher than 255 then it is invalid.  I have made that the limit
    now.
    
    In vhost_scsi_send_evt() we mask away values higher than 255, but now
    that the limit has changed, we don't need the mask.
