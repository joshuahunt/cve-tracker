Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 8821f5dc187bdf16cfb32ef5aa8c3035273fa79a
Author: Benjamin Tissoires <benjamin.tissoires@redhat.com>
Date:   Wed Sep 11 21:56:58 2013 +0200

    HID: multitouch: validate indexes details
    
    When working on report indexes, always validate that they are in bounds.
    Without this, a HID device could report a malicious feature report that
    could trick the driver into a heap overflow:
    
    [  634.885003] usb 1-1: New USB device found, idVendor=0596, idProduct=0500
    ...
    [  676.469629] BUG kmalloc-192 (Tainted: G        W   ): Redzone overwritten
    
    Note that we need to change the indexes from s8 to s16 as they can
    be between -1 and 255.
