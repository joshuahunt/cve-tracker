    packet: fix tp_reserve race in packet_set_ring
    
    Updates to tp_reserve can race with reads of the field in
    packet_set_ring. Avoid this by holding the socket lock during
    updates in setsockopt PACKET_RESERVE.
    
    This bug was discovered by syzkaller.

    udp: consistently apply ufo or fragmentation
    
    When iteratively building a UDP datagram with MSG_MORE and that
    datagram exceeds MTU, consistently choose UFO or fragmentation.
    
    Once skb_is_gso, always apply ufo. Conversely, once a datagram is
    split across multiple skbs, do not consider ufo.
    
    Sendpage already maintains the first invariant, only add the second.
    IPv6 does not have a sendpage implementation to modify.
    
    A gso skb must have a partial checksum, do not follow sk_no_check_tx
    in udp_send_skb.
    
    Found by syzkaller.

commit a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86

    fs/binfmt_elf.c: fix bug in loading of PIE binaries
    
    With CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_RANDOMIZE_PIE enabled, and a normal top-down
    address allocation strategy, load_elf_binary() will attempt to map a PIE
    binary into an address range immediately below mm->mmap_base.
    
    Unfortunately, load_elf_ binary() does not take account of the need to
    allocate sufficient space for the entire binary which means that, while
    the first PT_LOAD segment is mapped below mm->mmap_base, the subsequent
    PT_LOAD segment(s) end up being mapped above mm->mmap_base into the are
    that is supposed to be the "gap" between the stack and the binary.
    
    Since the size of the "gap" on x86_64 is only guaranteed to be 128MB this
    means that binaries with large data segments > 128MB can end up mapping
    part of their data segment over their stack resulting in corruption of the
    stack (and the data segment once the binary starts to run).
    
    Any PIE binary with a data segment > 128MB is vulnerable to this although
    address randomization means that the actual gap between the stack and the
    end of the binary is normally greater than 128MB.  The larger the data
    segment of the binary the higher the probability of failure.
    
    Fix this by calculating the total size of the binary in the same way as
    load_elf_interp().

    scsi: sg: fixup infoleak when using SG_GET_REQUEST_TABLE
    
    When calling SG_GET_REQUEST_TABLE ioctl only a half-filled table is
    returned; the remaining part will then contain stale kernel memory
    information.  This patch zeroes out the entire table to avoid this
    issue.
