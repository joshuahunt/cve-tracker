Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 29fa6825463c97e5157284db80107d1bfac5d77b
Author: Andy Lutomirski <luto@amacapital.net>
Date:   Fri Dec 5 19:03:28 2014 -0800

    x86, kvm: Clear paravirt_enabled on KVM guests for espfix32's benefit
    
    paravirt_enabled has the following effects:
    
     - Disables the F00F bug workaround warning.  There is no F00F bug
       workaround any more because Linux's standard IDT handling already
       works around the F00F bug, but the warning still exists.  This
       is only cosmetic, and, in any event, there is no such thing as
       KVM on a CPU with the F00F bug.
    
     - Disables 32-bit APM BIOS detection.  On a KVM paravirt system,
       there should be no APM BIOS anyway.
    
     - Disables tboot.  I think that the tboot code should check the
       CPUID hypervisor bit directly if it matters.
    
     - paravirt_enabled disables espfix32.  espfix32 should *not* be
       disabled under KVM paravirt.
    
    The last point is the purpose of this patch.  It fixes a leak of the
    high 16 bits of the kernel stack address on 32-bit KVM paravirt
    guests.  Fixes CVE-2014-8134.

    While the aim is increased security for --x memory maps, it does not

    ALSA: compress: fix an integer overflow check
    
    I previously added an integer overflow check here but looking at it now,
    it's still buggy.
    
    The bug happens in snd_compr_allocate_buffer().  We multiply
    ".fragments" and ".fragment_size" and that doesn't overflow but then we
    save it in an unsigned int so it truncates the high bits away and we
    allocate a smaller than expected size.

    mm: avoid setting up anonymous pages into file mapping
    
    Reading page fault handler code I've noticed that under right
    circumstances kernel would map anonymous pages into file mappings: if
    the VMA doesn't have vm_ops->fault() and the VMA wasn't fully populated
    on ->mmap(), kernel would handle page fault to not populated pte with
    do_anonymous_page().
    
    Let's change page fault handler to use do_anonymous_page() only on
    anonymous VMA (->vm_ops == NULL) and make sure that the VMA is not
    shared.
    
    For file mappings without vm_ops->fault() or shred VMA without vm_ops,
    page fault on pte_none() entry would lead to SIGBUS.

Author: Vladis Dronov <vdronov@redhat.com>
Date:   Sun Jan 31 14:14:52 2016 -0200

    [media] usbvision: revert commit 588afcc1
    
    Commit 588afcc1c0e4 ("[media] usbvision fix overflow of interfaces
    array")' should be reverted, because:
    
    * "!dev->actconfig->interface[ifnum]" won't catch a case where the value
    is not NULL but some garbage. This way the system may crash later with
    GPF.
    
    * "(ifnum >= USB_MAXINTERFACES)" does not cover all the error
    conditions. "ifnum" should be compared to "dev->actconfig->
    desc.bNumInterfaces", i.e. compared to the number of "struct
    usb_interface" kzalloc()-ed, not to USB_MAXINTERFACES.
    
    * There is a "struct usb_device" leak in this error path, as there is
    usb_get_dev(), but no usb_put_dev() on this path.
    
    * There is a bug of the same type several lines below with number of
    endpoints. The code is accessing hard-coded second endpoint
    ("interface->endpoint[1].desc") which may not exist. It would be great
    to handle this in the same patch too.
    
    * All the concerns above are resolved by already-accepted commit fa52bd50
    ("[media] usbvision: fix crash on detecting device with invalid
    configuration")

    sctp: Prevent soft lockup when sctp_accept() is called during a timeout event
    
    A case can occur when sctp_accept() is called by the user during
    a heartbeat timeout event after the 4-way handshake.  Since
    sctp_assoc_migrate() changes both assoc->base.sk and assoc->ep, the
    bh_sock_lock in sctp_generate_heartbeat_event() will be taken with
    the listening socket but released with the new association socket.
    The result is a deadlock on any future attempts to take the listening
    socket lock.
    
    Note that this race can occur with other SCTP timeouts that take
    the bh_lock_sock() in the event sctp_accept() is called.

    USB: fix invalid memory access in hub_activate()
    
    Commit 8520f38099cc ("USB: change hub initialization sleeps to
    delayed_work") changed the hub_activate() routine to make part of it
    run in a workqueue.  However, the commit failed to take a reference to
    the usb_hub structure or to lock the hub interface while doing so.  As
    a result, if a hub is plugged in and quickly unplugged before the work
    routine can run, the routine will try to access memory that has been
    deallocated.  Or, if the hub is unplugged while the routine is
    running, the memory may be deallocated while it is in active use.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by taking a reference to the usb_hub at
    the start of hub_activate() and releasing it at the end (when the work
    is finished), and by locking the hub interface while the work routine
    is running.  It also adds a check at the start of the routine to see
    if the hub has already been disconnected, in which nothing should be
    done.

    In commit c4004b02f8e5b ("x86: remove the kernel code/data/bss resources
    from /proc/iomem") I was hoping to remove the phyiscal kernel address
    data from /proc/iomem entirely, but that had to be reverted because some
    system programs actually use it.
    
    This limits all the detailed resource information to properly
    credentialed users instead.

    arm64: dma-mapping: always clear allocated buffers
    
    Buffers allocated by dma_alloc_coherent() are always zeroed on Alpha,
    ARM (32bit), MIPS, PowerPC, x86/x86_64 and probably other architectures.
    It turned out that some drivers rely on this 'feature'. Allocated buffer
    might be also exposed to userspace with dma_mmap() call, so clearing it
    is desired from security point of view to avoid exposing random memory
    to userspace. This patch unifies dma_alloc_coherent() behavior on ARM64
    architecture with other implementations by unconditionally zeroing
    allocated buffer.

    ext2: convert to mbcache2
    
    The conversion is generally straightforward. We convert filesystem from
    a global cache to per-fs one. Similarly to ext4 the tricky part is that
    xattr block corresponding to found mbcache entry can get freed before we
    get buffer lock for that block. So we have to check whether the entry is
    still valid after getting the buffer lock.

    ovl: fix dentry reference leak
    
    In ovl_copy_up_locked(), newdentry is leaked if the function exits through
    out_cleanup as this just to out after calling ovl_cleanup() - which doesn't
    actually release the ref on newdentry.
    
    The out_cleanup segment should instead exit through out2 as certainly
    newdentry leaks - and possibly upper does also, though this isn't caught
    given the catch of newdentry.
    
    Without this fix, something like the following is seen:
    
    	BUG: Dentry ffff880023e9eb20{i=f861,n=#ffff880023e82d90} still in use (1) [unmount of tmpfs tmpfs]
    	BUG: Dentry ffff880023ece640{i=0,n=bigfile}  still in use (1) [unmount of tmpfs tmpfs]
    
    when unmounting the upper layer after an error occurred in copyup.
    
    An error can be induced by creating a big file in a lower layer with
    something like:
    
    	dd if=/dev/zero of=/lower/a/bigfile bs=65536 count=1 seek=$((0xf000))
    
    to create a large file (4.1G).  Overlay an upper layer that is too small
    (on tmpfs might do) and then induce a copy up by opening it writably.

    arm64: perf: reject groups spanning multiple HW PMUs
    
    The perf core implicitly rejects events spanning multiple HW PMUs, as in
    these cases the event->ctx will differ. However this validation is
    performed after pmu::event_init() is called in perf_init_event(), and
    thus pmu::event_init() may be called with a group leader from a
    different HW PMU.
    
    The ARM64 PMU driver does not take this fact into account, and when
    validating groups assumes that it can call to_arm_pmu(event->pmu) for
    any HW event. When the event in question is from another HW PMU this is
    wrong, and results in dereferencing garbage.
    
    This patch updates the ARM64 PMU driver to first test for and reject
    events from other PMUs, moving the to_arm_pmu and related logic after
    this test. Fixes a crash triggered by perf_fuzzer on Linux-4.0-rc2, with
    a CCI PMU present:

    fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c: fix bugs in hugetlb_vmtruncate_list()
    
    Hillf Danton noticed bugs in the hugetlb_vmtruncate_list routine.  The
    argument end is of type pgoff_t.  It was being converted to a vaddr
    offset and passed to unmap_hugepage_range.  However, end was also being
    used as an argument to the vma_interval_tree_foreach controlling loop.
    In addition, the conversion of end to vaddr offset was incorrect.
    
    hugetlb_vmtruncate_list is called as part of a file truncate or
    fallocate hole punch operation.
    
    When truncating a hugetlbfs file, this bug could prevent some pages from
    being unmapped.  This is possible if there are multiple vmas mapping the
    file, and there is a sufficiently sized hole between the mappings.  The
    size of the hole between two vmas (A,B) must be such that the starting
    virtual address of B is greater than (ending virtual address of A <<
    PAGE_SHIFT).  In this case, the pages in B would not be unmapped.  If
    pages are not properly unmapped during truncate, the following BUG is
    hit:
    
    	kernel BUG at fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c:428!
    
    In the fallocate hole punch case, this bug could prevent pages from
    being unmapped as in the truncate case.  However, for hole punch the
    result is that unmapped pages will not be removed during the operation.
    For hole punch, it is also possible that more pages than desired will be
    unmapped.  This unnecessary unmapping will cause page faults to
    reestablish the mappings on subsequent page access.

    KEYS: Fix ASN.1 indefinite length object parsing
    
    This fixes CVE-2016-0758.
    
    In the ASN.1 decoder, when the length field of an ASN.1 value is extracted,
    it isn't validated against the remaining amount of data before being added
    to the cursor.  With a sufficiently large size indicated, the check:
    
    	datalen - dp < 2
    
    may then fail due to integer overflow.
    
    Fix this by checking the length indicated against the amount of remaining
    data in both places a definite length is determined.
    
    Whilst we're at it, make the following changes:
    
     (1) Check the maximum size of extended length does not exceed the capacity
         of the variable it's being stored in (len) rather than the type that
         variable is assumed to be (size_t).
    
     (2) Compare the EOC tag to the symbolic constant ASN1_EOC rather than the
         integer 0.
    
     (3) To reduce confusion, move the initialisation of len outside of:
    
    	for (len = 0; n > 0; n--) {
    
         since it doesn't have anything to do with the loop counter n.

    nfsd: check permissions when setting ACLs
    
    Use set_posix_acl, which includes proper permission checks, instead of
    calling ->set_acl directly.  Without this anyone may be able to grant
    themselves permissions to a file by setting the ACL.
    
    Lock the inode to make the new checks atomic with respect to set_acl.
    (Also, nfsd was the only caller of set_acl not locking the inode, so I
    suspect this may fix other races.)
    
    This also simplifies the code, and ensures our ACLs are checked by
    posix_acl_valid.
    
    The permission checks and the inode locking were lost with commit
    4ac7249e, which changed nfsd to use the set_acl inode operation directly
    instead of going through xattr handlers.

    proc: prevent stacking filesystems on top
    
    This prevents stacking filesystems (ecryptfs and overlayfs) from using
    procfs as lower filesystem.  There is too much magic going on inside
    procfs, and there is no good reason to stack stuff on top of procfs.
    
    (For example, procfs does access checks in VFS open handlers, and
    ecryptfs by design calls open handlers from a kernel thread that doesn't
    drop privileges or so.)

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 29d6455178a09e1dc340380c582b13356227e8df

Date:   Wed Jun 1 11:55:07 2016 +0200

    sched: panic on corrupted stack end
    
    Until now, hitting this BUG_ON caused a recursive oops (because oops
    handling involves do_exit(), which calls into the scheduler, which in
    turn raises an oops), which caused stuff below the stack to be
    overwritten until a panic happened (e.g.  via an oops in interrupt
    context, caused by the overwritten CPU index in the thread_info).
    
    Just panic directly.

    x86/mm: Add barriers and document switch_mm()-vs-flush synchronization
    
    When switch_mm() activates a new PGD, it also sets a bit that
    tells other CPUs that the PGD is in use so that TLB flush IPIs
    will be sent.  In order for that to work correctly, the bit
    needs to be visible prior to loading the PGD and therefore
    starting to fill the local TLB.
    
    Document all the barriers that make this work correctly and add
    a couple that were missing.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 42cb14b110a5698ccf26ce59c4441722605a3743
Author: Hugh Dickins <hughd@google.com>
Date:   Thu Nov 5 18:50:05 2015 -0800

    mm: migrate dirty page without clear_page_dirty_for_io etc
    
    clear_page_dirty_for_io() has accumulated writeback and memcg subtleties
    since v2.6.16 first introduced page migration; and the set_page_dirty()
    which completed its migration of PageDirty, later had to be moderated to
    __set_page_dirty_nobuffers(); then PageSwapBacked had to skip that too.
    
    No actual problems seen with this procedure recently, but if you look into
    what the clear_page_dirty_for_io(page)+set_page_dirty(newpage) is actually
    achieving, it turns out to be nothing more than moving the PageDirty flag,
    and its NR_FILE_DIRTY stat from one zone to another.
    
    It would be good to avoid a pile of irrelevant decrementations and
    incrementations, and improper event counting, and unnecessary descent of
    the radix_tree under tree_lock (to set the PAGECACHE_TAG_DIRTY which
    radix_tree_replace_slot() left in place anyway).
    
    Do the NR_FILE_DIRTY movement, like the other stats movements, while
    interrupts still disabled in migrate_page_move_mapping(); and don't even
    bother if the zone is the same.  Do the PageDirty movement there under
    tree_lock too, where old page is frozen and newpage not yet visible:
    bearing in mind that as soon as newpage becomes visible in radix_tree, an
    un-page-locked set_page_dirty() might interfere (or perhaps that's just
    not possible: anything doing so should already hold an additional
    reference to the old page, preventing its migration; but play safe).
    
    But we do still need to transfer PageDirty in migrate_page_copy(), for
    those who don't go the mapping route through migrate_page_move_mapping().

commit 9842df62004f366b9fed2423e24df10542ee0dc5

    KVM: MTRR: remove MSR 0x2f8
    
    MSR 0x2f8 accessed the 124th Variable Range MTRR ever since MTRR support
    was introduced by 9ba075a664df ("KVM: MTRR support").
    
    0x2f8 became harmful when 910a6aae4e2e ("KVM: MTRR: exactly define the
    size of variable MTRRs") shrinked the array of VR MTRRs from 256 to 8,
    which made access to index 124 out of bounds.  The surrounding code only
    WARNs in this situation, thus the guest gained a limited read/write
    access to struct kvm_arch_vcpu.
    
    0x2f8 is not a valid VR MTRR MSR, because KVM has/advertises only 16 VR
    MTRR MSRs, 0x200-0x20f.  Every VR MTRR is set up using two MSRs, 0x2f8
    was treated as a PHYSBASE and 0x2f9 would be its PHYSMASK, but 0x2f9 was
    not implemented in KVM, therefore 0x2f8 could never do anything useful
    and getting rid of it is safe.
    
    This fixes CVE-2016-3713.

    ipv6: add complete rcu protection around np->opt
    
    This patch addresses multiple problems :
    
    UDP/RAW sendmsg() need to get a stable struct ipv6_txoptions
    while socket is not locked : Other threads can change np->opt
    concurrently. Dmitry posted a syzkaller
    (http://github.com/google/syzkaller) program desmonstrating
    use-after-free.
    
    Starting with TCP/DCCP lockless listeners, tcp_v6_syn_recv_sock()
    and dccp_v6_request_recv_sock() also need to use RCU protection
    to dereference np->opt once (before calling ipv6_dup_options())
    
    This patch adds full RCU protection to np->opt

commit 3ce424e45411cf5a13105e0386b6ecf6eeb4f66f
Author: Roman Kagan <rkagan@virtuozzo.com>

    kvm:vmx: more complete state update on APICv on/off
    
    The function to update APICv on/off state (in particular, to deactivate
    it when enabling Hyper-V SynIC) is incomplete: it doesn't adjust
    APICv-related fields among secondary processor-based VM-execution
    controls.  As a result, Windows 2012 guests get stuck when SynIC-based
    auto-EOI interrupt intersected with e.g. an IPI in the guest.
    
    In addition, the MSR intercept bitmap isn't updated every time "virtualize
    x2APIC mode" is toggled.  This path can only be triggered by a malicious
    guest, because Windows didn't use x2APIC but rather their own synthetic
    APIC access MSRs; however a guest running in a SynIC-enabled VM could
    switch to x2APIC and thus obtain direct access to host APIC MSRs
    (CVE-2016-4440).
    
    The patch fixes those omissions.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 38327424b40bcebe2de92d07312c89360ac9229a
Author: Dan Carpenter <dan.carpenter@oracle.com>
Date:   Thu Jun 16 15:48:57 2016 +0100

    KEYS: potential uninitialized variable
    
    If __key_link_begin() failed then "edit" would be uninitialized.  I've
    added a check to fix that.
    
    This allows a random user to crash the kernel, though it's quite
    difficult to achieve.  There are three ways it can be done as the user
    would have to cause an error to occur in __key_link():
    
     (1) Cause the kernel to run out of memory.  In practice, this is difficult
         to achieve without ENOMEM cropping up elsewhere and aborting the
         attempt.
    
     (2) Revoke the destination keyring between the keyring ID being looked up
         and it being tested for revocation.  In practice, this is difficult to
         time correctly because the KEYCTL_REJECT function can only be used
         from the request-key upcall process.  Further, users can only make use
         of what's in /sbin/request-key.conf, though this does including a
         rejection debugging test - which means that the destination keyring
         has to be the caller's session keyring in practice.
    
     (3) Have just enough key quota available to create a key, a new session
         keyring for the upcall and a link in the session keyring, but not then
         sufficient quota to create a link in the nominated destination keyring
         so that it fails with EDQUOT.
    
    The bug can be triggered using option (3) above using something like the
    following:
    
    	echo 80 >/proc/sys/kernel/keys/root_maxbytes
    	keyctl request2 user debug:fred negate @t
    
    The above sets the quota to something much lower (80) to make the bug
    easier to trigger, but this is dependent on the system.  Note also that
    the name of the keyring created contains a random number that may be
    between 1 and 10 characters in size, so may throw the test off by
    changing the amount of quota used.
    
    Assuming the failure occurs, something like the following will be seen:
    
    	kfree_debugcheck: out of range ptr 6b6b6b6b6b6b6b68h

commit e6bd18f57aad1a2d1ef40e646d03ed0f2515c9e3

Date:   Sun Apr 10 19:13:13 2016 -0600

    IB/security: Restrict use of the write() interface
    
    The drivers/infiniband stack uses write() as a replacement for
    bi-directional ioctl().  This is not safe. There are ways to
    trigger write calls that result in the return structure that
    is normally written to user space being shunted off to user
    specified kernel memory instead.
    
    For the immediate repair, detect and deny suspicious accesses to
    the write API.
    
    For long term, update the user space libraries and the kernel API
    to something that doesn't present the same security vulnerabilities
    (likely a structured ioctl() interface).
    
    The impacted uAPI interfaces are generally only available if
    hardware from drivers/infiniband is installed in the system.

    percpu: fix synchronization between synchronous map extension and chunk destruction
    
    For non-atomic allocations, pcpu_alloc() can try to extend the area
    map synchronously after dropping pcpu_lock; however, the extension
    wasn't synchronized against chunk destruction and the chunk might get
    freed while extension is in progress.
    
    This patch fixes the bug by putting most of non-atomic allocations
    under pcpu_alloc_mutex to synchronize against pcpu_balance_work which
    is responsible for async chunk management including destruction.

    percpu: fix synchronization between chunk->map_extend_work and chunk destruction
    
    Atomic allocations can trigger async map extensions which is serviced
    by chunk->map_extend_work.  pcpu_balance_work which is responsible for

    We're currently asserting that targetoff + targetsize <= nextoff.
    
    Extend it to also check that targetoff is >= sizeof(xt_entry).
    Since this is generic code, add an argument pointing to the start of the
    match/target, we can then derive the base structure size from the delta.
    
    We also need the e->elems pointer in a followup change to validate matches.

    netfilter: x_tables: check for bogus target offset
    
    We're currently asserting that targetoff + targetsize <= nextoff.
    
    Extend it to also check that targetoff is >= sizeof(xt_entry).
    Since this is generic code, add an argument pointing to the start of the
    match/target, we can then derive the base structure size from the delta.
    
    We also need the e->elems pointer in a followup change to validate matches.

commit 19be0eaffa3ac7d8eb6784ad9bdbc7d67ed8e619

    mm: remove gup_flags FOLL_WRITE games from __get_user_pages()
    
    This is an ancient bug that was actually attempted to be fixed once
    (badly) by me eleven years ago in commit 4ceb5db9757a ("Fix
    get_user_pages() race for write access") but that was then undone due to
    problems on s390 by commit f33ea7f404e5 ("fix get_user_pages bug").
    
    In the meantime, the s390 situation has long been fixed, and we can now
    fix it by checking the pte_dirty() bit properly (and do it better).  The
    s390 dirty bit was implemented in abf09bed3cce ("s390/mm: implement
    software dirty bits") which made it into v3.9.  Earlier kernels will
    have to look at the page state itself.
    
    Also, the VM has become more scalable, and what used a purely
    theoretical race back then has become easier to trigger.
    
    To fix it, we introduce a new internal FOLL_COW flag to mark the "yes,
    we already did a COW" rather than play racy games with FOLL_WRITE that
    is very fundamental, and then use the pte dirty flag to validate that
    the FOLL_COW flag is still valid.

    media: fix airspy usb probe error path
    
    Fix a memory leak on probe error of the airspy usb device driver.
    
    The problem is triggered when more than 64 usb devices register with
    v4l2 of type VFL_TYPE_SDR or VFL_TYPE_SUBDEV.
    
    The memory leak is caused by the probe function of the airspy driver
    mishandeling errors and not freeing the corresponding control structures
    when an error occours registering the device to v4l2 core.
    
    A badusb device can emulate 64 of these devices, and then through
    continual emulated connect/disconnect of the 65th device, cause the
    kernel to run out of RAM and crash the kernel, thus causing a local DOS
    vulnerability.

commit 93d17397e4e2182fdaad503e2f9da46202c0f1c3
Author: Paul Mackerras <paulus@ozlabs.org>
Date:   Wed Jun 22 15:52:55 2016 +1000

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Save/restore TM state in H_CEDE
    
    It turns out that if the guest does a H_CEDE while the CPU is in
    a transactional state, and the H_CEDE does a nap, and the nap
    loses the architected state of the CPU (which is is allowed to do),
    then we lose the checkpointed state of the virtual CPU.  In addition,
    the transactional-memory state recorded in the MSR gets reset back
    to non-transactional, and when we try to return to the guest, we take
    a TM bad thing type of program interrupt because we are trying to
    transition from non-transactional to transactional with a hrfid
    instruction, which is not permitted.
    
    The result of the program interrupt occurring at that point is that
    the host CPU will hang in an infinite loop with interrupts disabled.
    Thus this is a denial of service vulnerability in the host which can
    be triggered by any guest (and depending on the guest kernel, it can
    potentially triggered by unprivileged userspace in the guest).
    
    This vulnerability has been assigned the ID CVE-2016-5412.
    
    To fix this, we save the TM state before napping and restore it
    on exit from the nap, when handling a H_CEDE in real mode.  The
    case where H_CEDE exits to host virtual mode is already OK (as are
    other hcalls which exit to host virtual mode) because the exit
    path saves the TM state.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Pull out TM state save/restore into separate procedures
    
    This moves the transactional memory state save and restore sequences
    out of the guest entry/exit paths into separate procedures.  This is
    so that these sequences can be used in going into and out of nap
    in a subsequent patch.
    
    The only code changes here are (a) saving and restore LR on the
    stack, since these new procedures get called with a bl instruction,
    (b) explicitly saving r1 into the PACA instead of assuming that
    HSTATE_HOST_R1(r13) is already set, and (c) removing an unnecessary
    and redundant setting of MSR[TM] that should have been removed by
    commit 9d4d0bdd9e0a ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Add transactional memory
    support", 2013-09-24) but wasn't.

    tcp: make challenge acks less predictable
    
    Yue Cao claims that current host rate limiting of challenge ACKS
    (RFC 5961) could leak enough information to allow a patient attacker
    to hijack TCP sessions. He will soon provide details in an academic
    paper.
    
    This patch increases the default limit from 100 to 1000, and adds
    some randomization so that the attacker can no longer hijack
    sessions without spending a considerable amount of probes.
    
    Based on initial analysis and patch from Linus.
    
    Note that we also have per socket rate limiting, so it is tempting
    to remove the host limit in the future.
    
    v2: randomize the count of challenge acks per second, not the period.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 8e96a87c5431c256feb65bcfc5aec92d9f7839b6
Author: Cyril Bur <cyrilbur@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Jun 17 14:58:34 2016 +1000

    powerpc/tm: Always reclaim in start_thread() for exec() class syscalls
    
    Userspace can quite legitimately perform an exec() syscall with a
    suspended transaction. exec() does not return to the old process, rather
    it load a new one and starts that, the expectation therefore is that the
    new process starts not in a transaction. Currently exec() is not treated
    any differently to any other syscall which creates problems.
    
    Firstly it could allow a new process to start with a suspended
    transaction for a binary that no longer exists. This means that the
    checkpointed state won't be valid and if the suspended transaction were
    ever to be resumed and subsequently aborted (a possibility which is
    exceedingly likely as exec()ing will likely doom the transaction) the
    new process will jump to invalid state.
    
    Secondly the incorrect attempt to keep the transactional state while
    still zeroing state for the new process creates at least two TM Bad
    Things. The first triggers on the rfid to return to userspace as
    start_thread() has given the new process a 'clean' MSR but the suspend
    will still be set in the hardware MSR. The second TM Bad Thing triggers
    in __switch_to() as the processor is still transactionally suspended but
    __switch_to() wants to zero the TM sprs for the new process.
    
    This is an example of the outcome of calling exec() with a suspended
    transaction. Note the first 700 is likely the first TM bad thing
    decsribed earlier only the kernel can't report it as we've loaded
    userspace registers. c000000000009980 is the rfid in
    fast_exception_return()

    s390/sclp_ctl: fix potential information leak with /dev/sclp
    
    The sclp_ctl_ioctl_sccb function uses two copy_from_user calls to
    retrieve the sclp request from user space. The first copy_from_user
    fetches the length of the request which is stored in the first two
    bytes of the request. The second copy_from_user gets the complete
    sclp request, but this copies the length field a second time.
    A malicious user may have changed the length in the meantime.

    audit: fix a double fetch in audit_log_single_execve_arg()
    
    There is a double fetch problem in audit_log_single_execve_arg()
    where we first check the execve(2) argumnets for any "bad" characters
    which would require hex encoding and then re-fetch the arguments for
    logging in the audit record[1].  Of course this leaves a window of
    opportunity for an unsavory application to munge with the data.
    
    This patch reworks things by only fetching the argument data once[2]
    into a buffer where it is scanned and logged into the audit
    records(s).  In addition to fixing the double fetch, this patch
    improves on the original code in a few other ways: better handling
    of large arguments which require encoding, stricter record length
    checking, and some performance improvements (completely unverified,
    but we got rid of some strlen() calls, that's got to be a good
    thing).
    
    As part of the development of this patch, I've also created a basic
    regression test for the audit-testsuite, the test can be tracked on
    GitHub at the following link:
    
     * https://github.com/linux-audit/audit-testsuite/issues/25
    
    [1] If you pay careful attention, there is actually a triple fetch
    problem due to a strnlen_user() call at the top of the function.
    
    [2] This is a tiny white lie, we do make a call to strnlen_user()
    prior to fetching the argument data.  I don't like it, but due to the
    way the audit record is structured we really have no choice unless we
    copy the entire argument at once (which would require a rather
    wasteful allocation).  The good news is that with this patch the
    kernel no longer relies on this strnlen_user() value for anything
    beyond recording it in the log, we also update it with a trustworthy
    value whenever possible.

    platform/chrome: cros_ec_dev - double fetch bug in ioctl
    
    We verify "u_cmd.outsize" and "u_cmd.insize" but we need to make sure
    that those values have not changed between the two copy_from_user()
    calls.  Otherwise it could lead to a buffer overflow.
    
    Additionally, cros_ec_cmd_xfer() can set s_cmd->insize to a lower value.
    We should use the new smaller value so we don't copy too much data to
    the user.

    apparmor: fix oops, validate buffer size in apparmor_setprocattr()
    
    When proc_pid_attr_write() was changed to use memdup_user apparmor's
    (interface violating) assumption that the setprocattr buffer was always
    a single page was violated.
    
    The size test is not strictly speaking needed as proc_pid_attr_write()
    will reject anything larger, but for the sake of robustness we can keep
    it in.
    
    SMACK and SELinux look safe to me, but somebody else should probably
    have a look just in case.
    
    Based on original patch from Vegard Nossum <vegard.nossum@oracle.com>
    modified for the case that apparmor provides null termination.

    ovl: verify upper dentry before unlink and rename
    
    Unlink and rename in overlayfs checked the upper dentry for staleness by
    verifying upper->d_parent against upperdir.  However the dentry can go
    stale also by being unhashed, for example.
    
    Expand the verification to actually look up the name again (under parent
    lock) and check if it matches the upper dentry.  This matches what the VFS
    does before passing the dentry to filesytem's unlink/rename methods, which
    excludes any inconsistency caused by overlayfs.

    vfs: rename: check backing inode being equal
    
    If a file is renamed to a hardlink of itself POSIX specifies that rename(2)
    should do nothing and return success.
    
    This condition is checked in vfs_rename().  However it won't detect hard
    links on overlayfs where these are given separate inodes on the overlayfs
    layer.
    
    Overlayfs itself detects this condition and returns success without doing
    anything, but then vfs_rename() will proceed as if this was a successful
    rename (detach_mounts(), d_move()).
    
    The correct thing to do is to detect this condition before even calling
    into overlayfs.  This patch does this by calling vfs_select_inode() to get
    the underlying inodes.

    IB/srpt: Simplify srpt_handle_tsk_mgmt()
    
    Let the target core check task existence instead of the SRP target
    driver. Additionally, let the target core check the validity of the
    task management request instead of the ib_srpt driver.
    
    This patch fixes the following kernel crash:

    aacraid: Check size values after double-fetch from user
    
    In aacraid's ioctl_send_fib() we do two fetches from userspace, one the
    get the fib header's size and one for the fib itself. Later we use the
    size field from the second fetch to further process the fib. If for some
    reason the size from the second fetch is different than from the first
    fix, we may encounter an out-of- bounds access in aac_fib_send(). We
    also check the sender size to insure it is not out of bounds. This was
    reported in https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116751 and was
    assigned CVE-2016-6480.

commit bb1fceca22492109be12640d49f5ea5a544c6bb4
Author: Eric Dumazet <edumazet@google.com>

    tcp: fix use after free in tcp_xmit_retransmit_queue()
    
    When tcp_sendmsg() allocates a fresh and empty skb, it puts it at the
    tail of the write queue using tcp_add_write_queue_tail()
    
    Then it attempts to copy user data into this fresh skb.
    
    If the copy fails, we undo the work and remove the fresh skb.
    
    Unfortunately, this undo lacks the change done to tp->highest_sack and
    we can leave a dangling pointer (to a freed skb)
    
    Later, tcp_xmit_retransmit_queue() can dereference this pointer and
    access freed memory. For regular kernels where memory is not unmapped,
    this might cause SACK bugs because tcp_highest_sack_seq() is buggy,
    returning garbage instead of tp->snd_nxt, but with various debug
    features like CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC, this can crash the kernel.
    
    This bug was found by Marco Grassi thanks to syzkaller.

commit 073931017b49d9458aa351605b43a7e34598caef

    posix_acl: Clear SGID bit when setting file permissions
    
    When file permissions are modified via chmod(2) and the user is not in
    the owning group or capable of CAP_FSETID, the setgid bit is cleared in
    inode_change_ok().  Setting a POSIX ACL via setxattr(2) sets the file
    permissions as well as the new ACL, but doesn't clear the setgid bit in
    a similar way; this allows to bypass the check in chmod(2).  Fix that.

    And, as Dmitry rightly assessed, that is because we can drop the
    reference and then touch it when the underlying recvmsg calls return
    some packets and then hit an error, which will make recvmmsg to set
    sock->sk->sk_err, oops, fix it.

    brcmfmac: avoid potential stack overflow in brcmf_cfg80211_start_ap()
    
    User-space can choose to omit NL80211_ATTR_SSID and only provide raw
    IE TLV data. When doing so it can provide SSID IE with length exceeding
    the allowed size. The driver further processes this IE copying it
    into a local variable without checking the length. Hence stack can be
    corrupted and used as exploit.

    tunnels: Don't apply GRO to multiple layers of encapsulation.
    
    When drivers express support for TSO of encapsulated packets, they
    only mean that they can do it for one layer of encapsulation.
    Supporting additional levels would mean updating, at a minimum,
    more IP length fields and they are unaware of this.
    
    No encapsulation device expresses support for handling offloaded
    encapsulated packets, so we won't generate these types of frames
    in the transmit path. However, GRO doesn't have a check for
    multiple levels of encapsulation and will attempt to build them.
    
    UDP tunnel GRO actually does prevent this situation but it only
    handles multiple UDP tunnels stacked on top of each other. This
    generalizes that solution to prevent any kind of tunnel stacking
    that would cause problems.
