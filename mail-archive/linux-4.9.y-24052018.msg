Description of fix for this vulnerability:

    random: set up the NUMA crng instances after the CRNG is fully initialized
    
    Until the primary_crng is fully initialized, don't initialize the NUMA
    crng nodes.  Otherwise users of /dev/urandom on NUMA systems before
    the CRNG is fully initialized can get very bad quality randomness.  Of
    course everyone should move to getrandom(2) where this won't be an
    issue, but there's a lot of legacy code out there.  This related to
    CVE-2018-1108.

    random: fix crng_ready() test
    
    The crng_init variable has three states:
    
    0: The CRNG is not initialized at all
    1: The CRNG has a small amount of entropy, hopefully good enough for
       early-boot, non-cryptographical use cases
    2: The CRNG is fully initialized and we are sure it is safe for
       cryptographic use cases.
    
    The crng_ready() function should only return true once we are in the
    last state.  This addresses CVE-2018-1108.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit dc12baacb95f205948f64dc936a47d89ee110117
Author: Theodore Ts'o <tytso@mit.edu>

    random: use a different mixing algorithm for add_device_randomness()
    
    add_device_randomness() use of crng_fast_load() was highly
    problematic.  Some callers of add_device_randomness() can pass in a
    large amount of static information.  This would immediately promote
    the crng_init state from 0 to 1, without really doing much to
    initialize the primary_crng's internal state with something even
    vaguely unpredictable.
    
    Since we don't have the speed constraints of add_interrupt_randomness(),
    we can do a better job mixing in the what unpredictability a device
    driver or architecture maintainer might see fit to give us, and do it
    in a way which does not bump the crng_init_cnt variable.
    
    Also, since add_device_randomness() doesn't bump any entropy
    accounting in crng_init state 0, mix the device randomness into the
    input_pool entropy pool as well.  This is related to CVE-2018-1108.
