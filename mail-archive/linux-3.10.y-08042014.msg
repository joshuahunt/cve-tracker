    skbuff: skb_segment: orphan frags before copying
    
    skb_segment copies frags around, so we need
    to copy them carefully to avoid accessing
    user memory after reporting completion to userspace
    through a callback.
    
    skb_segment doesn't normally happen on datapath:
    TSO needs to be disabled - so disabling zero copy
    in this case does not look like a big deal.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 621b5060e823301d0cba4cb52a7ee3491922d291

    powerpc/tm: Fix crash when forking inside a transaction
    
    When we fork/clone we currently don't copy any of the TM state to the new
    thread.  This results in a TM bad thing (program check) when the new process is
    switched in as the kernel does a tmrechkpt with TEXASR FS not set.  Also, since
    R1 is from userspace, we trigger the bad kernel stack pointer detection.  So we
    end up with something like this:
    
       Bad kernel stack pointer 0 at c0000000000404fc
       cpu 0x2: Vector: 700 (Program Check) at [c00000003ffefd40]
           pc: c0000000000404fc: restore_gprs+0xc0/0x148
           lr: 0000000000000000
           sp: 0
          msr: 9000000100201030
         current = 0xc000001dd1417c30
         paca    = 0xc00000000fe00800   softe: 0        irq_happened: 0x01
           pid   = 0, comm = swapper/2
       WARNING: exception is not recoverable, can't continue
    
    The below fixes this by flushing the TM state before we copy the task_struct to
    the clone.  To do this we go through the tmreclaim patch, which removes the
    checkpointed registers from the CPU and transitions the CPU out of TM suspend
    mode.  Hence we need to call tmrechkpt after to restore the checkpointed state
    and the TM mode for the current task.
    
    To make this fail from userspace is simply:
    	tbegin
    	li	r0, 2
    	sc
    	<boom>
    
    Kudos to Adhemerval Zanella Neto for finding this.
