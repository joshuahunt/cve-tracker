    libertas: potential oops in debugfs
    
    If we do a zero size allocation then it will oops.  Also we can't be
    sure the user passes us a NUL terminated string so I've added a
    terminator.
    
    This code can only be triggered by root.

    aacraid: prevent invalid pointer dereference
    
    It appears that driver runs into a problem here if fibsize is too small
    because we allocate user_srbcmd with fibsize size only but later we
    access it until user_srbcmd->sg.count to copy it over to srbcmd.
    
    It is not correct to test (fibsize < sizeof(*user_srbcmd)) because this
    structure already includes one sg element and this is not needed for
    commands without data.  So, we would recommend to add the following
    (instead of test for fibsize == 0).
