Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 008ba2a13f2d04c947adc536d19debb8fe66f110
Author: Willem de Bruijn <willemb@google.com>

    packet: hold bind lock when rebinding to fanout hook
    
    Packet socket bind operations must hold the po->bind_lock. This keeps
    po->running consistent with whether the socket is actually on a ptype
    list to receive packets.
    
    fanout_add unbinds a socket and its packet_rcv/tpacket_rcv call, then
    binds the fanout object to receive through packet_rcv_fanout.
    
    Make it hold the po->bind_lock when testing po->running and rebinding.
    Else, it can race with other rebind operations, such as that in
    packet_set_ring from packet_rcv to tpacket_rcv. Concurrent updates
    can result in a socket being added to a fanout group twice, causing
    use-after-free KASAN bug reports, among others.
    
    Reported independently by both trinity and syzkaller.
    Verified that the syzkaller reproducer passes after this patch.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 4971613c1639d8e5f102c4e797c3bf8f83a5a69e

    packet: in packet_do_bind, test fanout with bind_lock held
    
    Once a socket has po->fanout set, it remains a member of the group
    until it is destroyed. The prot_hook must be constant and identical
    across sockets in the group.
    
    If fanout_add races with packet_do_bind between the test of po->fanout
    and taking the lock, the bind call may make type or dev inconsistent
    with that of the fanout group.
    
    Hold po->bind_lock when testing po->fanout to avoid this race.
    
    I had to introduce artificial delay (local_bh_enable) to actually
    observe the race.
