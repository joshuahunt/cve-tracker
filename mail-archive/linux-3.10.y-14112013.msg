Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 7314e613d5ff9f0934f7a0f74ed7973b903315d1
Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>
Date:   Tue Oct 29 10:21:34 2013 -0700

    Fix a few incorrectly checked [io_]remap_pfn_range() calls
    
    Nico Golde reports a few straggling uses of [io_]remap_pfn_range() that
    really should use the vm_iomap_memory() helper.  This trivially converts
    two of them to the helper, and comments about why the third one really
    needs to continue to use remap_pfn_range(), and adds the missing size
    check.

    uml: check length in exitcode_proc_write()
    
    We don't cap the size of buffer from the user so we could write past the
    end of the array here.  Only root can write to this file.

    staging: wlags49_h2: buffer overflow setting station name
    
    We need to check the length parameter before doing the memcpy().  I've
    actually changed it to strlcpy() as well so that it's NUL terminated.
    
    You need CAP_NET_ADMIN to trigger these so it's not the end of the
    world.
