Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit b04c46190219a4f845e46a459e3102137b7f6cac
Author: Wang, Xiaoming <xiaoming.wang@intel.com>
Date:   Mon Apr 14 12:30:45 2014 -0400

    net: ipv4: current group_info should be put after using.
    
    Plug a group_info refcount leak in ping_init.
    group_info is only needed during initialization and
    the code failed to release the reference on exit.
    While here move grabbing the reference to a place
    where it is actually needed.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 05ab8f2647e4221cbdb3856dd7d32bd5407316b3
Author: Mathias Krause <minipli@googlemail.com>
Date:   Sun Apr 13 18:23:33 2014 +0200

    filter: prevent nla extensions to peek beyond the end of the message
    
    The BPF_S_ANC_NLATTR and BPF_S_ANC_NLATTR_NEST extensions fail to check
    for a minimal message length before testing the supplied offset to be
    within the bounds of the message. This allows the subtraction of the nla
    header to underflow and therefore -- as the data type is unsigned --
    allowing far to big offset and length values for the search of the
    netlink attribute.
    
    The remainder calculation for the BPF_S_ANC_NLATTR_NEST extension is
    also wrong. It has the minuend and subtrahend mixed up, therefore
    calculates a huge length value, allowing to overrun the end of the
    message while looking for the netlink attribute.
    
    The following three BPF snippets will trigger the bugs when attached to
    a UNIX datagram socket and parsing a message with length 1, 2 or 3.
    
     ,-[ PoC for missing size check in BPF_S_ANC_NLATTR ]--

     `---
    
    Fix the first issue by ensuring the message length fulfills the minimal
    size constrains of a nla header. Fix the second bug by getting the math
    for the remainder calculation right.
