    unix: properly account for FDs passed over unix sockets
    
    It is possible for a process to allocate and accumulate far more FDs than
    the process' limit by sending them over a unix socket then closing them
    to keep the process' fd count low.
    
    This change addresses this problem by keeping track of the number of FDs
    in flight per user and preventing non-privileged processes from having
    more FDs in flight than their configured FD limit.

    ecryptfs: forbid opening files without mmap handler
    
    This prevents users from triggering a stack overflow through a recursive
    invocation of pagefault handling that involves mapping procfs files into
    virtual memory.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:

    s390/mm: four page table levels vs. fork
    
    The fork of a process with four page table levels is broken since
    git commit 6252d702c5311ce9 "[S390] dynamic page tables."
    
    All new mm contexts are created with three page table levels and
    an asce limit of 4TB. If the parent has four levels dup_mmap will
    add vmas to the new context which are outside of the asce limit.
    The subsequent call to copy_page_range will walk the three level
    page table structure of the new process with non-zero pgd and pud
    indexes. This leads to memory clobbers as the pgd_index *and* the
    pud_index is added to the mm->pgd pointer without a pgd_deref
    in between.
    
    The init_new_context() function is selecting the number of page
    table levels for a new context. The function is used by mm_init()
    which in turn is called by dup_mm() and mm_alloc(). These two are
    used by fork() and exec(). The init_new_context() function can
    distinguish the two cases by looking at mm->context.asce_limit,
    for fork() the mm struct has been copied and the number of page
    table levels may not change. For exec() the mm_alloc() function
    set the new mm structure to zero, in this case a three-level page
    table is created as the temporary stack space is located at
    STACK_TOP_MAX = 4TB.
    
    This fixes CVE-2016-2143.

    unix: correctly track in-flight fds in sending process user_struct
    
    The commit referenced in the Fixes tag incorrectly accounted the number
    of in-flight fds over a unix domain socket to the original opener
    of the file-descriptor. This allows another process to arbitrary
    deplete the original file-openers resource limit for the maximum of
    open files. Instead the sending processes and its struct cred should
    be credited.
    
    To do so, we add a reference counted struct user_struct pointer to the
    scm_fp_list and use it to account for the number of inflight unix fds.

    ipv4: keep skb->dst around in presence of IP options
    
    Andrey Konovalov got crashes in __ip_options_echo() when a NULL skb->dst
    is accessed.
    
    ipv4_pktinfo_prepare() should not drop the dst if (evil) IP options
    are present.
    
    We could refine the test to the presence of ts_needtime or srr,
    but IP options are not often used, so let's be conservative.
    
    Thanks to syzkaller team for finding this bug.
