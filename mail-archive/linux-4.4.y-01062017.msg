    staging/android/ion : fix a race condition in the ion driver
    
    There is a use-after-free problem in the ion driver.
    This is caused by a race condition in the ion_ioctl()
    function.
    
    A handle has ref count of 1 and two tasks on different
    cpus calls ION_IOC_FREE simultaneously.
    
    cpu 0                                   cpu 1
    -------------------------------------------------------
    ion_handle_get_by_id()
    (ref == 2)
                                ion_handle_get_by_id()
                                (ref == 3)
    
    ion_free()
    (ref == 2)
    
    ion_handle_put()
    (ref == 1)
    
                                ion_free()
                                (ref == 0 so ion_handle_destroy() is
                                called
                                and the handle is freed.)
    
                                ion_handle_put() is called and it
                                decreases the slub's next free pointer
    
    The problem is detected as an unaligned access in the
    spin lock functions since it uses load exclusive
     instruction. In some cases it corrupts the slub's
    free pointer which causes a mis-aligned access to the
    next free pointer.(kmalloc returns a pointer like
    ffffc0745b4580aa). And it causes lots of other
    hard-to-debug problems.
    
    This symptom is caused since the first member in the
    ion_handle structure is the reference count and the
    ion driver decrements the reference after it has been
    freed.
    
    To fix this problem client->lock mutex is extended
    to protect all the codes that uses the handle.

    [media] dw2102: don't do DMA on stack
    
    On Kernel 4.9, WARNINGs about doing DMA on stack are hit at
    the dw2102 driver: one in su3000_power_ctrl() and the other in tt_s2_4600_frontend_attach().
    
    Both were due to the use of buffers on the stack as parameters to
    dvb_usb_generic_rw() and the resulting attempt to do DMA with them.
    
    The device was non-functional as a result.
    
    So, switch this driver over to use a buffer within the device state
    structure, as has been done with other DVB-USB drivers.
    
    Tested with TechnoTrend TT-connect S2-4600.

    [media] cxusb: Use a dma capable buffer also for reading
    
    Commit 17ce039b4e54 ("[media] cxusb: don't do DMA on stack")
    added a kmalloc'ed bounce buffer for writes, but missed to do the same
    for reads. As the read only happens after the write is finished, we can
    reuse the same buffer.
    
    As dvb_usb_generic_rw handles a read length of 0 by itself, avoid calling
    it using the dvb_usb_generic_read wrapper function.

    [media] dvb-usb-v2: avoid use-after-free
    
    I ran into a stack frame size warning because of the on-stack copy of
    the USB device structure:
    
    drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb-v2/dvb_usb_core.c: In function 'dvb_usbv2_disconnect':
    drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb-v2/dvb_usb_core.c:1029:1: error: the frame size of 1104 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]
    
    Copying a device structure like this is wrong for a number of other reasons
    too aside from the possible stack overflow. One of them is that the
    dev_info() call will print the name of the device later, but AFAICT
    we have only copied a pointer to the name earlier and the actual name
    has been freed by the time it gets printed.
    
    This removes the on-stack copy of the device and instead copies the
    device name using kstrdup(). I'm ignoring the possible failure here
    as both printk() and kfree() are able to deal with NULL pointers.

    crypto: ccm - move cbcmac input off the stack
    
    Commit f15f05b0a5de ("crypto: ccm - switch to separate cbcmac driver")
    refactored the CCM driver to allow separate implementations of the
    underlying MAC to be provided by a platform. However, in doing so, it
    moved some data from the linear region to the stack, which violates the
    SG constraints when the stack is virtually mapped.
    
    So move idata/odata back to the request ctx struct, of which we can
    reasonably expect that it has been allocated using kmalloc() et al.
