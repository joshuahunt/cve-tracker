Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit e54ad7f1ee263ffa5a2de9c609d58dfa27b21cd9
Author: Jann Horn <jannh@google.com>
Date:   Wed Jun 1 11:55:05 2016 +0200

    proc: prevent stacking filesystems on top
    
    This prevents stacking filesystems (ecryptfs and overlayfs) from using
    procfs as lower filesystem.  There is too much magic going on inside
    procfs, and there is no good reason to stack stuff on top of procfs.
    
    (For example, procfs does access checks in VFS open handlers, and
    ecryptfs by design calls open handlers from a kernel thread that doesn't
    drop privileges or so.)

    We're currently asserting that targetoff + targetsize <= nextoff.
    
    Extend it to also check that targetoff is >= sizeof(xt_entry).
    Since this is generic code, add an argument pointing to the start of the
    match/target, we can then derive the base structure size from the delta.
    
    We also need the e->elems pointer in a followup change to validate matches.

    bpf: fix incorrect tracking of register size truncation
    
    Properly handle register truncation to a smaller size.
    
    The old code first mirrors the clearing of the high 32 bits in the bitwise
    tristate representation, which is correct. But then, it computes the new
    arithmetic bounds as the intersection between the old arithmetic bounds and
    the bounds resulting from the bitwise tristate representation. Therefore,
    when coerce_reg_to_32() is called on a number with bounds
    [0xffff'fff8, 0x1'0000'0007], the verifier computes
    [0xffff'fff8, 0xffff'ffff] as bounds of the truncated number.
    This is incorrect: The truncated number could also be in the range [0, 7],
    and no meaningful arithmetic bounds can be computed in that case apart from
    the obvious [0, 0xffff'ffff].
    
    Starting with v4.14, this is exploitable by unprivileged users as long as
    the unprivileged_bpf_disabled sysctl isn't set.
    
    Debian assigned CVE-2017-16996 for this issue.
    
    v2:
     - flip the mask during arithmetic bounds calculation (Ben Hutchings)
    v3:
     - add CVE number (Ben Hutchings)

    dccp: fix freeing skb too early for IPV6_RECVPKTINFO
    
    In the current DCCP implementation an skb for a DCCP_PKT_REQUEST packet
    is forcibly freed via __kfree_skb in dccp_rcv_state_process if
    dccp_v6_conn_request successfully returns.
    
    However, if IPV6_RECVPKTINFO is set on a socket, the address of the skb
    is saved to ireq->pktopts and the ref count for skb is incremented in
    dccp_v6_conn_request, so skb is still in use. Nevertheless, it gets freed
    in dccp_rcv_state_process.
    
    Fix by calling consume_skb instead of doing goto discard and therefore
    calling __kfree_skb.
    
    Similar fixes for TCP:
    
    fb7e2399ec17f1004c0e0ccfd17439f8759ede01 [TCP]: skb is unexpectedly freed.

    ALSA: seq: Make ioctls race-free
    
    The ALSA sequencer ioctls have no protection against racy calls while
    the concurrent operations may lead to interfere with each other.  As
    reported recently, for example, the concurrent calls of setting client
    pool with a combination of write calls may lead to either the
    unkillable dead-lock or UAF.
    
    As a slightly big hammer solution, this patch introduces the mutex to
    make each ioctl exclusive.  Although this may reduce performance via
    parallel ioctl calls, usually it's not demanded for sequencer usages,
    hence it should be negligible.
