Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 5f2f97656ada8d811d3c1bef503ced266fcd53a0
Author: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>

    rxrpc: Fix several cases where a padded len isn't checked in ticket decode
    
    This fixes CVE-2017-7482.
    
    When a kerberos 5 ticket is being decoded so that it can be loaded into an
    rxrpc-type key, there are several places in which the length of a
    variable-length field is checked to make sure that it's not going to
    overrun the available data - but the data is padded to the nearest
    four-byte boundary and the code doesn't check for this extra.  This could
    lead to the size-remaining variable wrapping and the data pointer going
    over the end of the buffer.
    
    Fix this by making the various variable-length data checks use the padded
    length.
