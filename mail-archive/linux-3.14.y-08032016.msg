    pipe: limit the per-user amount of pages allocated in pipes
    
    On no-so-small systems, it is possible for a single process to cause an
    OOM condition by filling large pipes with data that are never read. A
    typical process filling 4000 pipes with 1 MB of data will use 4 GB of
    memory. On small systems it may be tricky to set the pipe max size to
    prevent this from happening.
    
    This patch makes it possible to enforce a per-user soft limit above
    which new pipes will be limited to a single page, effectively limiting
    them to 4 kB each, as well as a hard limit above which no new pipes may
    be created for this user. This has the effect of protecting the system
    against memory abuse without hurting other users, and still allowing
    pipes to work correctly though with less data at once.
    
    The limit are controlled by two new sysctls : pipe-user-pages-soft, and
    pipe-user-pages-hard. Both may be disabled by setting them to zero. The
    default soft limit allows the default number of FDs per process (1024)
    to create pipes of the default size (64kB), thus reaching a limit of 64MB
    before starting to create only smaller pipes. With 256 processes limited
    to 1024 FDs each, this results in 1024*64kB + (256*1024 - 1024) * 4kB =
    1084 MB of memory allocated for a user. The hard limit is disabled by
    default to avoid breaking existing applications that make intensive use
    of pipes (eg: for splicing).
