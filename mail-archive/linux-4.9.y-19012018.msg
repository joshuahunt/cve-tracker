Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit bfedb589252c01fa505ac9f6f2a3d5d68d707ef4
Author: Eric W. Biederman <ebiederm@xmission.com>
Date:   Thu Oct 13 21:23:16 2016 -0500

    mm: Add a user_ns owner to mm_struct and fix ptrace permission checks
    
    During exec dumpable is cleared if the file that is being executed is
    not readable by the user executing the file.  A bug in
    ptrace_may_access allows reading the file if the executable happens to
    enter into a subordinate user namespace (aka clone(CLONE_NEWUSER),
    unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER), or setns(fd, CLONE_NEWUSER).
    
    This problem is fixed with only necessary userspace breakage by adding
    a user namespace owner to mm_struct, captured at the time of exec, so
    it is clear in which user namespace CAP_SYS_PTRACE must be present in
    to be able to safely give read permission to the executable.
    
    The function ptrace_may_access is modified to verify that the ptracer
    has CAP_SYS_ADMIN in task->mm->user_ns instead of task->cred->user_ns.
    This ensures that if the task changes it's cred into a subordinate
    user namespace it does not become ptraceable.
    
    The function ptrace_attach is modified to only set PT_PTRACE_CAP when
    CAP_SYS_PTRACE is held over task->mm->user_ns.  The intent of
    PT_PTRACE_CAP is to be a flag to note that whatever permission changes
    the task might go through the tracer has sufficient permissions for
    it not to be an issue.  task->cred->user_ns is always the same
    as or descendent of mm->user_ns.  Which guarantees that having
    CAP_SYS_PTRACE over mm->user_ns is the worst case for the tasks
    credentials.
    
    To prevent regressions mm->dumpable and mm->user_ns are not considered
    when a task has no mm.  As simply failing ptrace_may_attach causes
    regressions in privileged applications attempting to read things
    such as /proc/<pid>/stat

    sg_write()/bsg_write() is not fit to be called under KERNEL_DS
    
    Both damn things interpret userland pointers embedded into the payload;
    worse, they are actually traversing those.  Leaving aside the bad
    API design, this is very much _not_ safe to call with KERNEL_DS.
    Bail out early if that happens.

    libceph: introduce ceph_crypt() for in-place en/decryption
    
    Starting with 4.9, kernel stacks may be vmalloced and therefore not
    guaranteed to be physically contiguous; the new CONFIG_VMAP_STACK
    option is enabled by default on x86.  This makes it invalid to use
    on-stack buffers with the crypto scatterlist API, as sg_set_buf()
    expects a logical address and won't work with vmalloced addresses.
    
    There isn't a different (e.g. kvec-based) crypto API we could switch
    net/ceph/crypto.c to and the current scatterlist.h API isn't getting
    updated to accommodate this use case.  Allocating a new header and
    padding for each operation is a non-starter, so do the en/decryption
    in-place on a single pre-assembled (header + data + padding) heap
    buffer.  This is explicitly supported by the crypto API:
    
        "... the caller may provide the same scatter/gather list for the
         plaintext and cipher text. After the completion of the cipher
         operation, the plaintext data is replaced with the ciphertext data
         in case of an encryption and vice versa for a decryption."

    cifs: Fix smbencrypt() to stop pointing a scatterlist at the stack
    
    smbencrypt() points a scatterlist to the stack, which is breaks if
    CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y.
    
    Fix it by switching to crypto_cipher_encrypt_one().  The new code
    should be considerably faster as an added benefit.
    
    This code is nearly identical to some code that Eric Biggers
    suggested.

    l2tp: fix racy SOCK_ZAPPED flag check in l2tp_ip{,6}_bind()
    
    Lock socket before checking the SOCK_ZAPPED flag in l2tp_ip6_bind().
    Without lock, a concurrent call could modify the socket flags between
    the sock_flag(sk, SOCK_ZAPPED) test and the lock_sock() call. This way,
    a socket could be inserted twice in l2tp_ip6_bind_table. Releasing it
    would then leave a stale pointer there, generating use-after-free
    errors when walking through the list or modifying adjacent entries.

commit 19be0eaffa3ac7d8eb6784ad9bdbc7d67ed8e619
Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>
Date:   Thu Oct 13 13:07:36 2016 -0700

    mm: remove gup_flags FOLL_WRITE games from __get_user_pages()
    
    This is an ancient bug that was actually attempted to be fixed once
    (badly) by me eleven years ago in commit 4ceb5db9757a ("Fix
    get_user_pages() race for write access") but that was then undone due to
    problems on s390 by commit f33ea7f404e5 ("fix get_user_pages bug").
    
    In the meantime, the s390 situation has long been fixed, and we can now
    fix it by checking the pte_dirty() bit properly (and do it better).  The
    s390 dirty bit was implemented in abf09bed3cce ("s390/mm: implement
    software dirty bits") which made it into v3.9.  Earlier kernels will
    have to look at the page state itself.
    
    Also, the VM has become more scalable, and what used a purely
    theoretical race back then has become easier to trigger.
    
    To fix it, we introduce a new internal FOLL_COW flag to mark the "yes,
    we already did a COW" rather than play racy games with FOLL_WRITE that
    is very fundamental, and then use the pte dirty flag to validate that
    the FOLL_COW flag is still valid.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit d29216842a85c7970c536108e093963f02714498

    mnt: Add a per mount namespace limit on the number of mounts
    
    CAI Qian <caiqian@redhat.com> pointed out that the semantics
    of shared subtrees make it possible to create an exponentially
    increasing number of mounts in a mount namespace.
    
        mkdir /tmp/1 /tmp/2
        mount --make-rshared /
        for i in $(seq 1 20) ; do mount --bind /tmp/1 /tmp/2 ; done
    
    Will create create 2^20 or 1048576 mounts, which is a practical problem
    as some people have managed to hit this by accident.
    
    As such CVE-2016-6213 was assigned.
    
    Ian Kent <raven@themaw.net> described the situation for autofs users
    as follows:
    
    > The number of mounts for direct mount maps is usually not very large because of
    > the way they are implemented, large direct mount maps can have performance
    > problems. There can be anywhere from a few (likely case a few hundred) to less
    > than 10000, plus mounts that have been triggered and not yet expired.
    >
    > Indirect mounts have one autofs mount at the root plus the number of mounts that
    > have been triggered and not yet expired.
    >
    > The number of autofs indirect map entries can range from a few to the common
    > case of several thousand and in rare cases up to between 30000 and 50000. I've
    > not heard of people with maps larger than 50000 entries.
    >
    > The larger the number of map entries the greater the possibility for a large
    > number of active mounts so it's not hard to expect cases of a 1000 or somewhat
    > more active mounts.
    
    So I am setting the default number of mounts allowed per mount
    namespace at 100,000.  This is more than enough for any use case I
    know of, but small enough to quickly stop an exponential increase
    in mounts.  Which should be perfect to catch misconfigurations and
    malfunctioning programs.
    
    For anyone who needs a higher limit this can be changed by writing
    to the new /proc/sys/fs/mount-max sysctl.

    net: add recursion limit to GRO
    
    Currently, GRO can do unlimited recursion through the gro_receive
    handlers.  This was fixed for tunneling protocols by limiting tunnel GRO
    to one level with encap_mark, but both VLAN and TEB still have this
    problem.  Thus, the kernel is vulnerable to a stack overflow, if we
    receive a packet composed entirely of VLAN headers.
    
    This patch adds a recursion counter to the GRO layer to prevent stack
    overflow.  When a gro_receive function hits the recursion limit, GRO is
    aborted for this skb and it is processed normally.  This recursion
    counter is put in the GRO CB, but could be turned into a percpu counter
    if we run out of space in the CB.
    
    Thanks to Vladimír Beneš <vbenes@redhat.com> for the initial bug report.

    KEYS: Fix short sprintf buffer in /proc/keys show function
    
    This fixes CVE-2016-7042.
    
    Fix a short sprintf buffer in proc_keys_show().  If the gcc stack protector
    is turned on, this can cause a panic due to stack corruption.
    
    The problem is that xbuf[] is not big enough to hold a 64-bit timeout
    rendered as weeks:
    
    	(gdb) p 0xffffffffffffffffULL/(60*60*24*7)
    	$2 = 30500568904943
    
    That's 14 chars plus NUL, not 11 chars plus NUL.
    
    Expand the buffer to 16 chars.
    
    I think the unpatched code apparently works if the stack-protector is not
    enabled because on a 32-bit machine the buffer won't be overflowed and on a
    64-bit machine there's a 64-bit aligned pointer at one side and an int that
    isn't checked again on the other side.
    
    The panic incurred looks something like:
    
    Kernel panic - not syncing: stack-protector: Kernel stack is corrupted in: ffffffff81352ebe

    posix_acl: Clear SGID bit when setting file permissions
    
    When file permissions are modified via chmod(2) and the user is not in
    the owning group or capable of CAP_FSETID, the setgid bit is cleared in
    inode_change_ok().  Setting a POSIX ACL via setxattr(2) sets the file
    permissions as well as the new ACL, but doesn't clear the setgid bit in
    a similar way; this allows to bypass the check in chmod(2).  Fix that.

    tipc: check minimum bearer MTU
    
    Qian Zhang (张谦) reported a potential socket buffer overflow in
    tipc_msg_build() which is also known as CVE-2016-8632: due to
    insufficient checks, a buffer overflow can occur if MTU is too short for
    even tipc headers. As anyone can set device MTU in a user/net namespace,
    this issue can be abused by a regular user.
    
    As agreed in the discussion on Ben Hutchings' original patch, we should
    check the MTU at the moment a bearer is attached rather than for each
    processed packet. We also need to repeat the check when bearer MTU is
    adjusted to new device MTU. UDP case also needs a check to avoid
    overflow when calculating bearer MTU.

    firewire: net: guard against rx buffer overflows
    
    The IP-over-1394 driver firewire-net lacked input validation when
    handling incoming fragmented datagrams.  A maliciously formed fragment
    with a respectively large datagram_offset would cause a memcpy past the
    datagram buffer.
    
    So, drop any packets carrying a fragment with offset + length larger
    than datagram_size.
    
    In addition, ensure that
      - GASP header, unfragmented encapsulation header, or fragment
        encapsulation header actually exists before we access it,
      - the encapsulated datagram or fragment is of nonzero size.

    tcp: take care of truncations done by sk_filter()
    
    With syzkaller help, Marco Grassi found a bug in TCP stack,
    crashing in tcp_collapse()
    
    Root cause is that sk_filter() can truncate the incoming skb,
    but TCP stack was not really expecting this to happen.
    It probably was expecting a simple DROP or ACCEPT behavior.
    
    We first need to make sure no part of TCP header could be removed.
    Then we need to adjust TCP_SKB_CB(skb)->end_seq
    
    Many thanks to syzkaller team and Marco for giving us a reproducer.

    mpi: Fix NULL ptr dereference in mpi_powm() [ver #3]
    
    This fixes CVE-2016-8650.
    
    If mpi_powm() is given a zero exponent, it wants to immediately return
    either 1 or 0, depending on the modulus.  However, if the result was
    initalised with zero limb space, no limbs space is allocated and a
    NULL-pointer exception ensues.
    
    Fix this by allocating a minimal amount of limb space for the result when
    the 0-exponent case when the result is 1 and not touching the limb space
    when the result is 0.
    
    This affects the use of RSA keys and X.509 certificates that carry them.

    packet: fix race condition in packet_set_ring
    
    When packet_set_ring creates a ring buffer it will initialize a
    struct timer_list if the packet version is TPACKET_V3. This value
    can then be raced by a different thread calling setsockopt to
    set the version to TPACKET_V1 before packet_set_ring has finished.
    
    This leads to a use-after-free on a function pointer in the
    struct timer_list when the socket is closed as the previously
    initialized timer will not be deleted.
    
    The bug is fixed by taking lock_sock(sk) in packet_setsockopt when
    changing the packet version while also taking the lock at the start
    of packet_set_ring.

    vfio/pci: Fix integer overflows, bitmask check
    
    The VFIO_DEVICE_SET_IRQS ioctl did not sufficiently sanitize
    user-supplied integers, potentially allowing memory corruption. This
    patch adds appropriate integer overflow checks, checks the range bounds
    for VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_NONE, and also verifies that only single element
    in the VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_TYPE_MASK bitmask is set.
    VFIO_IRQ_SET_ACTION_TYPE_MASK is already correctly checked later in
    vfio_pci_set_irqs_ioctl().
    
    Furthermore, a kzalloc is changed to a kcalloc because the use of a
    kzalloc with an integer multiplication allowed an integer overflow
    condition to be reached without this patch. kcalloc checks for overflow
    and should prevent a similar occurrence.

    vfio/pci: Fix integer overflows, bitmask check
    
    The VFIO_DEVICE_SET_IRQS ioctl did not sufficiently sanitize
    user-supplied integers, potentially allowing memory corruption. This
    patch adds appropriate integer overflow checks, checks the range bounds
    for VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_NONE, and also verifies that only single element
    in the VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_TYPE_MASK bitmask is set.
    VFIO_IRQ_SET_ACTION_TYPE_MASK is already correctly checked later in
    vfio_pci_set_irqs_ioctl().
    
    Furthermore, a kzalloc is changed to a kcalloc because the use of a
    kzalloc with an integer multiplication allowed an integer overflow
    condition to be reached without this patch. kcalloc checks for overflow
    and should prevent a similar occurrence.

    One cgroup maintainer mentioned that "cgroup is trying to offline
    a cpuset css, which takes place under cgroup_mutex.  The offlining
    ends up trying to drain active usages of a sysctl table which apprently
    is not happening."
    The real reason is that proc_sys_readdir doesn't drop reference added
    by grab_header when return from !dir_emit_dots path. So this cpuset
    offline path will wait here forever.

commit 7df3e59c3d1df4f87fe874c7956ef7a3d2f4d5fb
Author: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>
Date:   Wed Oct 26 15:02:01 2016 +0100

    KEYS: Sort out big_key initialisation
    
    big_key has two separate initialisation functions, one that registers the
    key type and one that registers the crypto.  If the key type fails to
    register, there's no problem if the crypto registers successfully because
    there's no way to reach the crypto except through the key type.
    
    However, if the key type registers successfully but the crypto does not,
    big_key_rng and big_key_blkcipher may end up set to NULL - but the code
    neither checks for this nor unregisters the big key key type.
    
    Furthermore, since the key type is registered before the crypto, it is
    theoretically possible for the kernel to try adding a big_key before the
    crypto is set up, leading to the same effect.
    
    Fix this by merging big_key_crypto_init() and big_key_init() and calling
    the resulting function late.  If they're going to be encrypted, we
    shouldn't be creating big_keys before we have the facilities to do the
    encryption available.  The key type registration is also moved after the
    crypto initialisation.
    
    The fix also includes message printing on failure.
    
    If the big_key type isn't correctly set up, simply doing:
    
    	dd if=/dev/zero bs=4096 count=1 | keyctl padd big_key a @s
    
    ought to cause an oops.

    sctp: validate chunk len before actually using it
    
    Andrey Konovalov reported that KASAN detected that SCTP was using a slab
    beyond the boundaries. It was caused because when handling out of the
    blue packets in function sctp_sf_ootb() it was checking the chunk len
    only after already processing the first chunk, validating only for the
    2nd and subsequent ones.
    
    The fix is to just move the check upwards so it's also validated for the
    1st chunk.

    KEYS: Disallow keyrings beginning with '.' to be joined as session keyrings
    
    This fixes CVE-2016-9604.
    
    Keyrings whose name begin with a '.' are special internal keyrings and so
    userspace isn't allowed to create keyrings by this name to prevent
    shadowing.  However, the patch that added the guard didn't fix
    KEYCTL_JOIN_SESSION_KEYRING.  Not only can that create dot-named keyrings,
    it can also subscribe to them as a session keyring if they grant SEARCH
    permission to the user.
    
    This, for example, allows a root process to set .builtin_trusted_keys as
    its session keyring, at which point it has full access because now the
    possessor permissions are added.  This permits root to add extra public
    keys, thereby bypassing module verification.
    
    This also affects kexec and IMA.
    
    This can be tested by (as root):
    
    	keyctl session .builtin_trusted_keys
    	keyctl add user a a @s
    	keyctl list @s
    
    which on my test box gives me:
    
    	2 keys in keyring:
    	180010936: ---lswrv     0     0 asymmetric: Build time autogenerated kernel key: ae3d4a31b82daa8e1a75b49dc2bba949fd992a05
    	801382539: --alswrv     0     0 user: a
    
    
    Fix this by rejecting names beginning with a '.' in the keyctl.

    netfilter: ipv6: nf_defrag: drop mangled skb on ream error
    
    Dmitry Vyukov reported GPF in network stack that Andrey traced down to
    negative nh offset in nf_ct_frag6_queue().
    
    Problem is that all network headers before fragment header are pulled.
    Normal ipv6 reassembly will drop the skb when errors occur further down
    the line.
    
    netfilter doesn't do this, and instead passed the original fragment
    along.  That was also fine back when netfilter ipv6 defrag worked with
    cloned fragments, as the original, pristine fragment was passed on.
    
    So we either have to undo the pull op, or discard such fragments.
    Since they're malformed after all (e.g. overlapping fragment) it seems
    preferrable to just drop them.
    
    Same for temporary errors -- it doesn't make sense to accept (and
    perhaps forward!) only some fragments of same datagram.

    KVM: x86: drop error recovery in em_jmp_far and em_ret_far
    
    em_jmp_far and em_ret_far assumed that setting IP can only fail in 64
    bit mode, but syzkaller proved otherwise (and SDM agrees).
    Code segment was restored upon failure, but it was left uninitialized
    outside of long mode, which could lead to a leak of host kernel stack.
    We could have fixed that by always saving and restoring the CS, but we
    take a simpler approach and just break any guest that manages to fail
    as the error recovery is error-prone and modern CPUs don't need emulator
    for this.

    net: avoid signed overflows for SO_{SND|RCV}BUFFORCE
    
    CAP_NET_ADMIN users should not be allowed to set negative
    sk_sndbuf or sk_rcvbuf values, as it can lead to various memory
    corruptions, crashes, OOM...
    
    Note that before commit 82981930125a ("net: cleanups in
    sock_setsockopt()"), the bug was even more serious, since SO_SNDBUF
    and SO_RCVBUF were vulnerable.
    
    This needs to be backported to all known linux kernels.
    
    Again, many thanks to syzkaller team for discovering this gem.

    tracing: Use strlcpy() instead of strcpy() in __trace_find_cmdline()
    
    Strcpy is inherently not safe, and strlcpy() should be used instead.
    __trace_find_cmdline() uses strcpy() because the comms saved must have a
    terminating nul character, but it doesn't hurt to add the extra protection
    of using strlcpy() instead of strcpy().

    KVM: VMX: Do not BUG() on out-of-bounds guest IRQ
    
    The value of the guest_irq argument to vmx_update_pi_irte() is
    ultimately coming from a KVM_IRQFD API call. Do not BUG() in
    vmx_update_pi_irte() if the value is out-of bounds. (Especially,
    since KVM as a whole seems to hang after that.)
    
    Instead, print a message only once if we find that we don't have a
    route for a certain IRQ (which can be out-of-bounds or within the
    array).
    
    This fixes CVE-2017-1000252.

    powerpc/tm: Fix illegal TM state in signal handler
    
    Currently it's possible that on returning from the signal handler
    through the restore_tm_sigcontexts() code path (e.g. from a signal
    caught due to a `trap` instruction executed in the middle of an HTM
    block, or a deliberately constructed sigframe) an illegal TM state
    (like TS=10 TM=0, i.e. "T0") is set in SRR1 and when `rfid` sets
    implicitly the MSR register from SRR1 register on return to userspace
    it causes a TM Bad Thing exception.
    
    That illegal state can be set (a) by a malicious user that disables
    the TM bit by tweaking the bits in uc_mcontext before returning from
    the signal handler or (b) by a sufficient number of context switches
    occurring such that the load_tm counter overflows and TM is disabled
    whilst in the signal handler.
    
    This commit fixes the illegal TM state by ensuring that TM bit is
    always enabled before we return from restore_tm_sigcontexts(). A small
    comment correction is made as well.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 265e60a170d0a0ecfc2d20490134ed2c48dd45ab
Author: Cyril Bur <cyrilbur@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Aug 17 20:42:26 2017 +1000

    powerpc/64s: Use emergency stack for kernel TM Bad Thing program checks
    
    When using transactional memory (TM), the CPU can be in one of six
    states as far as TM is concerned, encoded in the Machine State
    Register (MSR). Certain state transitions are illegal and if attempted
    trigger a "TM Bad Thing" type program check exception.
    
    If we ever hit one of these exceptions it's treated as a bug, ie. we
    oops, and kill the process and/or panic, depending on configuration.
    
    One case where we can trigger a TM Bad Thing, is when returning to
    userspace after a system call or interrupt, using RFID. When this
    happens the CPU first restores the user register state, in particular
    r1 (the stack pointer) and then attempts to update the MSR. However
    the MSR update is not allowed and so we take the program check with
    the user register state, but the kernel MSR.
    
    This tricks the exception entry code into thinking we have a bad
    kernel stack pointer, because the MSR says we're coming from the
    kernel, but r1 is pointing to userspace.
    
    To avoid this we instead always switch to the emergency stack if we
    take a TM Bad Thing from the kernel. That way none of the user
    register values are used, other than for printing in the oops message.
    
    This is the fix for CVE-2017-1000255.

    ALSA: timer: Fix missing queue indices reset at SNDRV_TIMER_IOCTL_SELECT
    
    snd_timer_user_tselect() reallocates the queue buffer dynamically, but
    it forgot to reset its indices.  Since the read may happen
    concurrently with ioctl and snd_timer_user_tselect() allocates the
    buffer via kmalloc(), this may lead to the leak of uninitialized
    kernel-space data, as spotted via KMSAN:

    ALSA: timer: Fix race between read and ioctl
    
    The read from ALSA timer device, the function snd_timer_user_tread(),
    may access to an uninitialized struct snd_timer_user fields when the
    read is concurrently performed while the ioctl like
    snd_timer_user_tselect() is invoked.  We have already fixed the races
    among ioctls via a mutex, but we seem to have forgotten the race
    between read vs ioctl.
    
    This patch simply applies (more exactly extends the already applied
    range of) tu->ioctl_lock in snd_timer_user_tread() for closing the
    race window.

    driver core: platform: fix race condition with driver_override
    
    The driver_override implementation is susceptible to race condition when
    different threads are reading vs storing a different driver override.
    Add locking to avoid race condition.

    KVM: MMU: always terminate page walks at level 1
    
    is_last_gpte() is not equivalent to the pseudo-code given in commit
    6bb69c9b69c31 ("KVM: MMU: simplify last_pte_bitmap") because an incorrect
    value of last_nonleaf_level may override the result even if level == 1.
    
    It is critical for is_last_gpte() to return true on level == 1 to
    terminate page walks. Otherwise memory corruption may occur as level
    is used as an index to various data structures throughout the page
    walking code.  Even though the actual bug would be wherever the MMU is
    initialized (as in the previous patch), be defensive and ensure here
    that is_last_gpte() returns the correct value.
    
    This patch is also enough to fix CVE-2017-12188.

    KVM: nVMX: update last_nonleaf_level when initializing nested EPT
    
    The function updates context->root_level but didn't call
    update_last_nonleaf_level so the previous and potentially wrong value
    was used for page walks.  For example, a zero value of last_nonleaf_level

    packet: hold bind lock when rebinding to fanout hook
    
    Packet socket bind operations must hold the po->bind_lock. This keeps
    po->running consistent with whether the socket is actually on a ptype
    list to receive packets.
    
    fanout_add unbinds a socket and its packet_rcv/tpacket_rcv call, then
    binds the fanout object to receive through packet_rcv_fanout.
    
    Make it hold the po->bind_lock when testing po->running and rebinding.
    Else, it can race with other rebind operations, such as that in
    packet_set_ring from packet_rcv to tpacket_rcv. Concurrent updates
    can result in a socket being added to a fanout group twice, causing
    use-after-free KASAN bug reports, among others.
    
    Reported independently by both trinity and syzkaller.
    Verified that the syzkaller reproducer passes after this patch.

    packet: in packet_do_bind, test fanout with bind_lock held
    
    Once a socket has po->fanout set, it remains a member of the group
    until it is destroyed. The prot_hook must be constant and identical
    across sockets in the group.
    
    If fanout_add races with packet_do_bind between the test of po->fanout
    and taking the lock, the bind call may make type or dev inconsistent
    with that of the fanout group.
    
    Hold po->bind_lock when testing po->fanout to avoid this race.
    
    I had to introduce artificial delay (local_bh_enable) to actually
    observe the race.

    dvb_frontend: don't use-after-free the frontend struct
    
    dvb_frontend_invoke_release() may free the frontend struct.
    So, the free logic can't update it anymore after calling it.
    
    That's OK, as __dvb_frontend_free() is called only when the
    krefs are zeroed, so nobody is using it anymore.
    
    That should fix the following KASAN error:

    tty: n_hdlc: get rid of racy n_hdlc.tbuf
    
    Currently N_HDLC line discipline uses a self-made singly linked list for
    data buffers and has n_hdlc.tbuf pointer for buffer retransmitting after
    an error.
    
    The commit be10eb7589337e5defbe214dae038a53dd21add8
    ("tty: n_hdlc add buffer flushing") introduced racy access to n_hdlc.tbuf.
    After tx error concurrent flush_tx_queue() and n_hdlc_send_frames() can put
    one data buffer to tx_free_buf_list twice. That causes double free in
    n_hdlc_release().
    
    Let's use standard kernel linked list and get rid of n_hdlc.tbuf:
    in case of tx error put current data buffer after the head of tx_buf_list.

    mm/slab.c: fix SLAB freelist randomization duplicate entries
    
    This patch fixes a bug in the freelist randomization code.  When a high
    random number is used, the freelist will contain duplicate entries.  It
    will result in different allocations sharing the same chunk.
    
    It will result in odd behaviours and crashes.  It should be uncommon but
    it depends on the machines.  We saw it happening more often on some
    machines (every few hours of running tests).

    drm/vc4: Fix an integer overflow in temporary allocation layout.
    
    We copy the unvalidated ioctl arguments from the user into kernel
    temporary memory to run the validation from, to avoid a race where the
    user updates the unvalidate contents in between validating them and
    copying them into the validated BO.
    
    However, in setting up the layout of the kernel side, we failed to
    check one of the additions (the roundup() for shader_rec_offset)
    against integer overflow, allowing a nearly MAX_UINT value of
    bin_cl_size to cause us to under-allocate the temporary space that we
    then copy_from_user into.

    ipv4: keep skb->dst around in presence of IP options
    
    Andrey Konovalov got crashes in __ip_options_echo() when a NULL skb->dst
    is accessed.
    
    ipv4_pktinfo_prepare() should not drop the dst if (evil) IP options
    are present.
    
    We could refine the test to the presence of ts_needtime or srr,
    but IP options are not often used, so let's be conservative.

    sctp_wait_for_sndbuf if the socket tx buffer is full, a thread is
    waiting on it to queue more data and meanwhile another thread peels off
    the association being used by the first thread.
    
    This patch replaces the BUG_ON call with a proper error handling. It
    will return -EPIPE to the original sendmsg call, similarly to what would
    have been done if the association wasn't found in the first place.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 321027c1fe77f892f4ea07846aeae08cefbbb290
Author: Peter Zijlstra <peterz@infradead.org>
Date:   Wed Jan 11 21:09:50 2017 +0100

    perf/core: Fix concurrent sys_perf_event_open() vs. 'move_group' race
    
    Di Shen reported a race between two concurrent sys_perf_event_open()
    calls where both try and move the same pre-existing software group
    into a hardware context.
    
    The problem is exactly that described in commit:
    
      f63a8daa5812 ("perf: Fix event->ctx locking")
    
    ... where, while we wait for a ctx->mutex acquisition, the event->ctx
    relation can have changed under us.
    
    That very same commit failed to recognise sys_perf_event_context() as an
    external access vector to the events and thereby didn't apply the
    established locking rules correctly.
    
    So while one sys_perf_event_open() call is stuck waiting on
    mutex_lock_double(), the other (which owns said locks) moves the group
    about. So by the time the former sys_perf_event_open() acquires the
    locks, the context we've acquired is stale (and possibly dead).
    
    Apply the established locking rules as per perf_event_ctx_lock_nested()
    to the mutex_lock_double() for the 'move_group' case. This obviously means
    we need to validate state after we acquire the locks.

    tcp: avoid infinite loop in tcp_splice_read()
    
    Splicing from TCP socket is vulnerable when a packet with URG flag is
    received and stored into receive queue.
    
    __tcp_splice_read() returns 0, and sk_wait_data() immediately
    returns since there is the problematic skb in queue.
    
    This is a nice way to burn cpu (aka infinite loop) and trigger
    soft lockups.

    sctp: deny peeloff operation on asocs with threads sleeping on it
    
    commit 2dcab5984841 ("sctp: avoid BUG_ON on sctp_wait_for_sndbuf")
    attempted to avoid a BUG_ON call when the association being used for a
    sendmsg() is blocked waiting for more sndbuf and another thread did a
    peeloff operation on such asoc, moving it to another socket.
    
    As Ben Hutchings noticed, then in such case it would return without
    locking back the socket and would cause two unlocks in a row.
    
    Further analysis also revealed that it could allow a double free if the
    application managed to peeloff the asoc that is created during the
    sendmsg call, because then sctp_sendmsg() would try to free the asoc
    that was created only for that call.
    
    This patch takes another approach. It will deny the peeloff operation
    if there is a thread sleeping on the asoc, so this situation doesn't
    exist anymore. This avoids the issues described above and also honors
    the syscalls that are already being handled (it can be multiple sendmsg
    calls).
    
    Joint work with Xin Long.

    ucount: Remove the atomicity from ucount->count
    
    Always increment/decrement ucount->count under the ucounts_lock.  The
    increments are there already and moving the decrements there means the
    locking logic of the code is simpler.  This simplification in the
    locking logic fixes a race between put_ucounts and get_ucounts that
    could result in a use-after-free because the count could go zero then
    be found by get_ucounts and then be freed by put_ucounts.
    
    A bug presumably this one was found by a combination of syzkaller and
    KASAN.  JongWhan Kim reported the syzkaller failure and Dmitry Vyukov
    spotted the race in the code.

    xfrm_user: validate XFRM_MSG_NEWAE XFRMA_REPLAY_ESN_VAL replay_window
    
    When a new xfrm state is created during an XFRM_MSG_NEWSA call we
    validate the user supplied replay_esn to ensure that the size is valid
    and to ensure that the replay_window size is within the allocated
    buffer.  However later it is possible to update this replay_esn via a
    XFRM_MSG_NEWAE call.  There we again validate the size of the supplied
    buffer matches the existing state and if so inject the contents.  We do
    not at this point check that the replay_window is within the allocated
    memory.  This leads to out-of-bounds reads and writes triggered by
    netlink packets.  This leads to memory corruption and the potential for
    priviledge escalation.
    
    We already attempt to validate the incoming replay information in
    xfrm_new_ae() via xfrm_replay_verify_len().  This confirms that the user
    is not trying to change the size of the replay state buffer which
    includes the replay_esn.  It however does not check the replay_window
    remains within that buffer.  Add validation of the contained
    replay_window.

    tcp: fix SCM_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_STATS for normal skbs
    
    __sock_recv_timestamp can be called for both normal skbs (for
    receive timestamps) and for skbs on the error queue (for transmit
    timestamps).
    
    Commit 1c885808e456
    (tcp: SOF_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_STATS option for SO_TIMESTAMPING)
    assumes any skb passed to __sock_recv_timestamp are from
    the error queue, containing OPT_STATS in the content of the skb.
    This results in accessing invalid memory or generating junk
    data.
    
    To fix this, set skb->pkt_type to PACKET_OUTGOING for packets
    on the error queue. This is safe because on the receive path
    on local sockets skb->pkt_type is never set to PACKET_OUTGOING.
    With that, copy OPT_STATS from a packet, only if its pkt_type
    is PACKET_OUTGOING.

    drm/vmwgfx: fix integer overflow in vmw_surface_define_ioctl()
    
    In vmw_surface_define_ioctl(), the 'num_sizes' is the sum of the
    'req->mip_levels' array. This array can be assigned any value from
    the user space. As both the 'num_sizes' and the array is uint32_t,
    it is easy to make 'num_sizes' overflow. The later 'mip_levels' is
    used as the loop count. This can lead an oob write. Add the check of
    'req->mip_levels' to avoid this.

    net/packet: fix overflow in check for priv area size
    
    Subtracting tp_sizeof_priv from tp_block_size and casting to int
    to check whether one is less then the other doesn't always work
    (both of them are unsigned ints).
    
    Compare them as is instead.
    
    Also cast tp_sizeof_priv to u64 before using BLK_PLUS_PRIV, as
    it can overflow inside BLK_PLUS_PRIV otherwise.

    fscrypt: remove broken support for detecting keyring key revocation
    
    Filesystem encryption ostensibly supported revoking a keyring key that
    had been used to "unlock" encrypted files, causing those files to become
    "locked" again.  This was, however, buggy for several reasons, the most
    severe of which was that when key revocation happened to be detected for
    an inode, its fscrypt_info was immediately freed, even while other
    threads could be using it for encryption or decryption concurrently.
    This could be exploited to crash the kernel or worse.
    
    This patch fixes the use-after-free by removing the code which detects
    the keyring key having been revoked, invalidated, or expired.  Instead,
    an encrypted inode that is "unlocked" now simply remains unlocked until
    it is evicted from memory.  Note that this is no worse than the case for
    block device-level encryption, e.g. dm-crypt, and it still remains
    possible for a privileged user to evict unused pages, inodes, and
    dentries by running 'sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches', or by
    simply unmounting the filesystem.  In fact, one of those actions was
    already needed anyway for key revocation to work even somewhat sanely.
    This change is not expected to break any applications.
    
    In the future I'd like to implement a real API for fscrypt key
    revocation that interacts sanely with ongoing filesystem operations ---
    waiting for existing operations to complete and blocking new operations,
    and invalidating and sanitizing key material and plaintext from the VFS
    caches.  But this is a hard problem, and for now this bug must be fixed.
    
    This bug affected almost all versions of ext4, f2fs, and ubifs
    encryption, and it was potentially reachable in any kernel configured
    with encryption support (CONFIG_EXT4_ENCRYPTION=y,
    CONFIG_EXT4_FS_ENCRYPTION=y, CONFIG_F2FS_FS_ENCRYPTION=y, or
    CONFIG_UBIFS_FS_ENCRYPTION=y).  Note that older kernels did not use the
    shared fs/crypto/ code, but due to the potential security implications
    of this bug, it may still be worthwhile to backport this fix to them.

    KEYS: fix keyctl_set_reqkey_keyring() to not leak thread keyrings
    
    This fixes CVE-2017-7472.
    
    Running the following program as an unprivileged user exhausts kernel
    memory by leaking thread keyrings:
    
    	#include <keyutils.h>
    
    	int main()
    	{
    		for (;;)
    			keyctl_set_reqkey_keyring(KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_THREAD_KEYRING);
    	}
    
    Fix it by only creating a new thread keyring if there wasn't one before.
    To make things more consistent, make install_thread_keyring_to_cred()
    and install_process_keyring_to_cred() both return 0 if the corresponding
    keyring is already present.

    macsec: avoid heap overflow in skb_to_sgvec
    
    While this may appear as a humdrum one line change, it's actually quite
    important. An sk_buff stores data in three places:
    
    1. A linear chunk of allocated memory in skb->data. This is the easiest
       one to work with, but it precludes using scatterdata since the memory
       must be linear.
    2. The array skb_shinfo(skb)->frags, which is of maximum length
       MAX_SKB_FRAGS. This is nice for scattergather, since these fragments
       can point to different pages.
    3. skb_shinfo(skb)->frag_list, which is a pointer to another sk_buff,
       which in turn can have data in either (1) or (2).
    
    The first two are rather easy to deal with, since they're of a fixed
    maximum length, while the third one is not, since there can be
    potentially limitless chains of fragments. Fortunately dealing with
    frag_list is opt-in for drivers, so drivers don't actually have to deal
    with this mess. For whatever reason, macsec decided it wanted pain, and
    so it explicitly specified NETIF_F_FRAGLIST.
    
    Because dealing with (1), (2), and (3) is insane, most users of sk_buff
    doing any sort of crypto or paging operation calls a convenient function
    called skb_to_sgvec (which happens to be recursive if (3) is in use!).
    This takes a sk_buff as input, and writes into its output pointer an
    array of scattergather list items. Sometimes people like to declare a
    fixed size scattergather list on the stack; othertimes people like to
    allocate a fixed size scattergather list on the heap. However, if you're
    doing it in a fixed-size fashion, you really shouldn't be using
    NETIF_F_FRAGLIST too (unless you're also ensuring the sk_buff and its
    frag_list children arent't shared and then you check the number of
    fragments in total required.)
    
    Macsec specifically does this:
    
            size += sizeof(struct scatterlist) * (MAX_SKB_FRAGS + 1);
            tmp = kmalloc(size, GFP_ATOMIC);
            *sg = (struct scatterlist *)(tmp + sg_offset);
    	...
            sg_init_table(sg, MAX_SKB_FRAGS + 1);
            skb_to_sgvec(skb, sg, 0, skb->len);
    
    Specifying MAX_SKB_FRAGS + 1 is the right answer usually, but not if you're
    using NETIF_F_FRAGLIST, in which case the call to skb_to_sgvec will
    overflow the heap, and disaster ensues.

    dentry name snapshots
    
    take_dentry_name_snapshot() takes a safe snapshot of dentry name;
    if the name is a short one, it gets copied into caller-supplied
    structure, otherwise an extra reference to external name is grabbed
    (those are never modified).  In either case the pointer to stable
    string is stored into the same structure.
    
    dentry must be held by the caller of take_dentry_name_snapshot(),
    but may be freely dropped afterwards - the snapshot will stay
    until destroyed by release_dentry_name_snapshot().
    
    Intended use:
    	struct name_snapshot s;
    
    	take_dentry_name_snapshot(&s, dentry);
    	...
    	access s.name
    	...
    	release_dentry_name_snapshot(&s);
    
    Replaces fsnotify_oldname_...(), gets used in fsnotify to obtain the name

    crypto: ahash - Fix EINPROGRESS notification callback
    
    The ahash API modifies the request's callback function in order
    to clean up after itself in some corner cases (unaligned final
    and missing finup).
    
    When the request is complete ahash will restore the original
    callback and everything is fine.  However, when the request gets
    an EBUSY on a full queue, an EINPROGRESS callback is made while
    the request is still ongoing.
    
    In this case the ahash API will incorrectly call its own callback.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by creating a temporary request
    object on the stack which is used to relay EINPROGRESS back to
    the original completion function.
    
    This patch also adds code to preserve the original flags value.

    net sched actions: allocate act cookie early
    
    Policing filters do not use the TCA_ACT_* enum and the tb[]
    nlattr array in tcf_action_init_1() doesn't get filled for
    them so we should not try to look for a TCA_ACT_COOKIE
    attribute in the then uninitialized array.
    The error handling in cookie allocation then calls
    tcf_hash_release() leading to invalid memory access later
    on.
    Additionally, if cookie allocation fails after an already
    existing non-policing filter has successfully been changed,
    tcf_action_release() should not be called, also we would
    have to roll back the changes in the error handling, so
    instead we now allocate the cookie early and assign it on
    success at the end.

    [media] dvb-usb-firmware: don't do DMA on stack
    
    The buffer allocation for the firmware data was changed in
    commit 43fab9793c1f ("[media] dvb-usb: don't use stack for firmware load")
    but the same applies for the reset value.

    [media] dw2102: don't do DMA on stack
    
    On Kernel 4.9, WARNINGs about doing DMA on stack are hit at
    the dw2102 driver: one in su3000_power_ctrl() and the other in tt_s2_4600_frontend_attach().
    
    Both were due to the use of buffers on the stack as parameters to
    dvb_usb_generic_rw() and the resulting attempt to do DMA with them.
    
    The device was non-functional as a result.
    
    So, switch this driver over to use a buffer within the device state
    structure, as has been done with other DVB-USB drivers.
    
    Tested with TechnoTrend TT-connect S2-4600.

    [media] cxusb: Use a dma capable buffer also for reading
    
    Commit 17ce039b4e54 ("[media] cxusb: don't do DMA on stack")
    added a kmalloc'ed bounce buffer for writes, but missed to do the same
    for reads. As the read only happens after the write is finished, we can
    reuse the same buffer.
    
    As dvb_usb_generic_rw handles a read length of 0 by itself, avoid calling
    it using the dvb_usb_generic_read wrapper function.

    [media] dvb-usb-v2: avoid use-after-free
    
    I ran into a stack frame size warning because of the on-stack copy of
    the USB device structure:
    
    drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb-v2/dvb_usb_core.c: In function 'dvb_usbv2_disconnect':
    drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb-v2/dvb_usb_core.c:1029:1: error: the frame size of 1104 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]
    
    Copying a device structure like this is wrong for a number of other reasons
    too aside from the possible stack overflow. One of them is that the
    dev_info() call will print the name of the device later, but AFAICT
    we have only copied a pointer to the name earlier and the actual name
    has been freed by the time it gets printed.
    
    This removes the on-stack copy of the device and instead copies the
    device name using kstrdup(). I'm ignoring the possible failure here
    as both printk() and kfree() are able to deal with NULL pointers.

    crypto: ccm - move cbcmac input off the stack
    
    Commit f15f05b0a5de ("crypto: ccm - switch to separate cbcmac driver")
    refactored the CCM driver to allow separate implementations of the
    underlying MAC to be provided by a platform. However, in doing so, it
    moved some data from the linear region to the stack, which violates the
    SG constraints when the stack is virtually mapped.
    
    So move idata/odata back to the request ctx struct, of which we can
    reasonably expect that it has been allocated using kmalloc() et al.

    bpf: don't let ldimm64 leak map addresses on unprivileged
    
    The patch fixes two things at once:
    
    1) It checks the env->allow_ptr_leaks and only prints the map address to
       the log if we have the privileges to do so, otherwise it just dumps 0
       as we would when kptr_restrict is enabled on %pK. Given the latter is
       off by default and not every distro sets it, I don't want to rely on
       this, hence the 0 by default for unprivileged.
    
    2) Printing of ldimm64 in the verifier log is currently broken in that
       we don't print the full immediate, but only the 32 bit part of the
       first insn part for ldimm64. Thus, fix this up as well; it's okay to

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 07678eca2cf9c9a18584e546c2b2a0d0c9a3150c
Author: Sinclair Yeh <syeh@vmware.com>
Date:   Fri Jun 2 07:50:57 2017 +0200

    drm/vmwgfx: Make sure backup_handle is always valid
    
    When vmw_gb_surface_define_ioctl() is called with an existing buffer,
    we end up returning an uninitialized variable in the backup_handle.
    
    The fix is to first initialize backup_handle to 0 just to be sure, and
    second, when a user-provided buffer is found, we will use the
    req->buffer_handle as the backup_handle.
