Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 163ae1c6ad6299b19e22b4a35d5ab24a89791a98

    fscrypto: add authorization check for setting encryption policy
    
    On an ext4 or f2fs filesystem with file encryption supported, a user
    could set an encryption policy on any empty directory(*) to which they
    had readonly access.  This is obviously problematic, since such a
    directory might be owned by another user and the new encryption policy
    would prevent that other user from creating files in their own directory
    (for example).
    
    Fix this by requiring inode_owner_or_capable() permission to set an
    encryption policy.  This means that either the caller must own the file,
    or the caller must have the capability CAP_FOWNER.
    
    (*) Or also on any regular file, for f2fs v4.6 and later and ext4
        v4.8-rc1 and later; a separate bug fix is coming for that.
