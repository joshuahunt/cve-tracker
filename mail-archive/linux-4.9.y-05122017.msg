Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit a8f97366452ed491d13cf1e44241bc0b5740b1f0

    mm, thp: Do not make page table dirty unconditionally in touch_p[mu]d()
    
    Currently, we unconditionally make page table dirty in touch_pmd().
    It may result in false-positive can_follow_write_pmd().
    
    We may avoid the situation, if we would only make the page table entry
    dirty if caller asks for write access -- FOLL_WRITE.
    
    The patch also changes touch_pud() in the same way.

    [media] cx231xx-cards: fix NULL-deref on missing association descriptor
    
    Make sure to check that we actually have an Interface Association
    Descriptor before dereferencing it during probe to avoid dereferencing a
    NULL-pointer.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 31cbee6a5611f07d2d66f55bb6f8648db5947e32

    sound: Disable the build of OSS drivers
    
    OSS drivers are left as badly unmaintained, and now we're facing a
    problem to clean up the hackish set_fs() usage in their codes.  Since
    most of drivers have been covered by ALSA, and the others are dead old
    and inactive, let's leave them RIP.
    
    This patch is the first step: disable the build of OSS drivers.
    We'll eventually drop the whole codes and clean up later.
    
    Note that sound/oss/dmasound is still kept, since it's a completely
    different implementation of OSS, and it doesn't suffer from set_fs()
    hack.  Moreover, the build of ALSA is disabled on M68K by some reason,
    thus disabling it shall result in a regression.  This one will be
    disabled / removed once when we add the support in ALSA side.
