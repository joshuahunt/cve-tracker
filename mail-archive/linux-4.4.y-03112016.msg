    [media] usbvision: revert commit 588afcc1
    
    Commit 588afcc1c0e4 ("[media] usbvision fix overflow of interfaces
    array")' should be reverted, because:
    
    * "!dev->actconfig->interface[ifnum]" won't catch a case where the value
    is not NULL but some garbage. This way the system may crash later with
    GPF.
    
    * "(ifnum >= USB_MAXINTERFACES)" does not cover all the error
    conditions. "ifnum" should be compared to "dev->actconfig->
    desc.bNumInterfaces", i.e. compared to the number of "struct
    usb_interface" kzalloc()-ed, not to USB_MAXINTERFACES.
    
    * There is a "struct usb_device" leak in this error path, as there is
    usb_get_dev(), but no usb_put_dev() on this path.
    
    * There is a bug of the same type several lines below with number of
    endpoints. The code is accessing hard-coded second endpoint
    ("interface->endpoint[1].desc") which may not exist. It would be great
    to handle this in the same patch too.
    
    * All the concerns above are resolved by already-accepted commit fa52bd50
    ("[media] usbvision: fix crash on detecting device with invalid
    configuration")

    ext4: fix races of writeback with punch hole and zero range
    
    When doing delayed allocation, update of on-disk inode size is postponed
    until IO submission time. However hole punch or zero range fallocate
    calls can end up discarding the tail page cache page and thus on-disk
    inode size would never be properly updated.
    
    Make sure the on-disk inode size is updated before truncating page
    cache.

    ext4: move unlocked dio protection from ext4_alloc_file_blocks()
    
    Currently ext4_alloc_file_blocks() was handling protection against
    unlocked DIO. However we now need to sometimes call it under i_mmap_sem
    and sometimes not and DIO protection ranks above it (although strictly
    speaking this cannot currently create any deadlocks). Also
    ext4_zero_range() was actually getting & releasing unlocked DIO
    protection twice in some cases. Luckily it didn't introduce any real bug
    but it was a land mine waiting to be stepped on.  So move DIO protection
    out from ext4_alloc_file_blocks() into the two callsites.

    ext4: fix races between buffered IO and collapse / insert range
    
    Current code implementing FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE and
    FALLOC_FL_INSERT_RANGE is prone to races with buffered writes and page
    faults. If buffered write or write via mmap manages to squeeze between
    filemap_write_and_wait_range() and truncate_pagecache() in the fallocate
    implementations, the written data is simply discarded by
    truncate_pagecache() although it should have been shifted.
    
    Fix the problem by moving filemap_write_and_wait_range() call inside
    i_mutex and i_mmap_sem. That way we are protected against races with
    both buffered writes and page faults.

Author: Jan Kara <jack@suse.com>

    ext4: fix races between page faults and hole punching
    
    Currently, page faults and hole punching are completely unsynchronized.
    This can result in page fault faulting in a page into a range that we
    are punching after truncate_pagecache_range() has been called and thus
    we can end up with a page mapped to disk blocks that will be shortly
    freed. Filesystem corruption will shortly follow. Note that the same
    race is avoided for truncate by checking page fault offset against
    i_size but there isn't similar mechanism available for punching holes.
    
    Fix the problem by creating new rw semaphore i_mmap_sem in inode and
    grab it for writing over truncate, hole punching, and other functions
    removing blocks from extent tree and for read over page faults. We
    cannot easily use i_data_sem for this since that ranks below transaction
    start and we need something ranking above it so that it can be held over
    the whole truncate / hole punching operation. Also remove various
    workarounds we had in the code to reduce race window when page fault
    could have created pages with stale mapping information.

    /proc/iomem: only expose physical resource addresses to privileged users
    
    In commit c4004b02f8e5b ("x86: remove the kernel code/data/bss resources
    from /proc/iomem") I was hoping to remove the phyiscal kernel address
    data from /proc/iomem entirely, but that had to be reverted because some
    system programs actually use it.
    
    This limits all the detailed resource information to properly
    credentialed users instead.

    ext2: convert to mbcache2
    
    The conversion is generally straightforward. We convert filesystem from
    a global cache to per-fs one. Similarly to ext4 the tricky part is that
    xattr block corresponding to found mbcache entry can get freed before we
    get buffer lock for that block. So we have to check whether the entry is
    still valid after getting the buffer lock.

    fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c: fix bugs in hugetlb_vmtruncate_list()
    
    Hillf Danton noticed bugs in the hugetlb_vmtruncate_list routine.  The
    argument end is of type pgoff_t.  It was being converted to a vaddr
    offset and passed to unmap_hugepage_range.  However, end was also being
    used as an argument to the vma_interval_tree_foreach controlling loop.
    In addition, the conversion of end to vaddr offset was incorrect.
    
    hugetlb_vmtruncate_list is called as part of a file truncate or
    fallocate hole punch operation.
    
    When truncating a hugetlbfs file, this bug could prevent some pages from
    being unmapped.  This is possible if there are multiple vmas mapping the
    file, and there is a sufficiently sized hole between the mappings.  The
    size of the hole between two vmas (A,B) must be such that the starting
    virtual address of B is greater than (ending virtual address of A <<
    PAGE_SHIFT).  In this case, the pages in B would not be unmapped.  If
    pages are not properly unmapped during truncate, the following BUG is
    hit:
    
    	kernel BUG at fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c:428!
    
    In the fallocate hole punch case, this bug could prevent pages from
    being unmapped as in the truncate case.  However, for hole punch the
    result is that unmapped pages will not be removed during the operation.
    For hole punch, it is also possible that more pages than desired will be
    unmapped.  This unnecessary unmapping will cause page faults to
    reestablish the mappings on subsequent page access.

    tty: Fix unsafe ldisc reference via ioctl(TIOCGETD)
    
    ioctl(TIOCGETD) retrieves the line discipline id directly from the
    ldisc because the line discipline id (c_line) in termios is untrustworthy;
    userspace may have set termios via ioctl(TCSETS*) without actually
    changing the line discipline via ioctl(TIOCSETD).
    
    However, directly accessing the current ldisc via tty->ldisc is
    unsafe; the ldisc ptr dereferenced may be stale if the line discipline
    is changing via ioctl(TIOCSETD) or hangup.
    
    Wait for the line discipline reference (just like read() or write())
    to retrieve the "current" line discipline id.

    KEYS: Fix keyring ref leak in join_session_keyring()
    
    This fixes CVE-2016-0728.
    
    If a thread is asked to join as a session keyring the keyring that's already
    set as its session, we leak a keyring reference.
    
    This can be tested with the following program:
    
    	#include <stddef.h>
    	#include <stdio.h>
    	#include <sys/types.h>
    	#include <keyutils.h>
    
    	int main(int argc, const char *argv[])
    	{
    		int i = 0;
    		key_serial_t serial;
    
    		serial = keyctl(KEYCTL_JOIN_SESSION_KEYRING,
    				"leaked-keyring");
    		if (serial < 0) {
    			perror("keyctl");
    			return -1;
    		}
    
    		if (keyctl(KEYCTL_SETPERM, serial,
    			   KEY_POS_ALL | KEY_USR_ALL) < 0) {
    			perror("keyctl");
    			return -1;
    		}
    
    		for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    			serial = keyctl(KEYCTL_JOIN_SESSION_KEYRING,
    					"leaked-keyring");
    			if (serial < 0) {
    				perror("keyctl");
    				return -1;
    			}
    		}
    
    		return 0;
    	}
    
    If, after the program has run, there something like the following line in
    /proc/keys:
    
    3f3d898f I--Q---   100 perm 3f3f0000     0     0 keyring   leaked-keyring: empty
    
    with a usage count of 100 * the number of times the program has been run,
    then the kernel is malfunctioning.  If leaked-keyring has zero usages or
    has been garbage collected, then the problem is fixed.

    KEYS: Fix ASN.1 indefinite length object parsing
    
    This fixes CVE-2016-0758.
    
    In the ASN.1 decoder, when the length field of an ASN.1 value is extracted,
    it isn't validated against the remaining amount of data before being added
    to the cursor.  With a sufficiently large size indicated, the check:
    
    	datalen - dp < 2
    
    may then fail due to integer overflow.
    
    Fix this by checking the length indicated against the amount of remaining
    data in both places a definite length is determined.
    
    Whilst we're at it, make the following changes:
    
     (1) Check the maximum size of extended length does not exceed the capacity
         of the variable it's being stored in (len) rather than the type that
         variable is assumed to be (size_t).
    
     (2) Compare the EOC tag to the symbolic constant ASN1_EOC rather than the
         integer 0.
    
     (3) To reduce confusion, move the initialisation of len outside of:
    
    	for (len = 0; n > 0; n--) {
    
         since it doesn't have anything to do with the loop counter n.

Author: Ben Hutchings <ben@decadent.org.uk>
Date:   Wed Jun 22 19:43:35 2016 +0100

    nfsd: check permissions when setting ACLs
    
    Use set_posix_acl, which includes proper permission checks, instead of
    calling ->set_acl directly.  Without this anyone may be able to grant
    themselves permissions to a file by setting the ACL.
    
    Lock the inode to make the new checks atomic with respect to set_acl.
    (Also, nfsd was the only caller of set_acl not locking the inode, so I
    suspect this may fix other races.)
    
    This also simplifies the code, and ensures our ACLs are checked by
    posix_acl_valid.
    
    The permission checks and the inode locking were lost with commit
    4ac7249e, which changed nfsd to use the set_acl inode operation directly
    instead of going through xattr handlers.

    ecryptfs: forbid opening files without mmap handler
    
    This prevents users from triggering a stack overflow through a recursive
    invocation of pagefault handling that involves mapping procfs files into

    proc: prevent stacking filesystems on top
    
    This prevents stacking filesystems (ecryptfs and overlayfs) from using
    procfs as lower filesystem.  There is too much magic going on inside
    procfs, and there is no good reason to stack stuff on top of procfs.
    
    (For example, procfs does access checks in VFS open handlers, and
    ecryptfs by design calls open handlers from a kernel thread that doesn't
    drop privileges or so.)

    sched: panic on corrupted stack end
    
    Until now, hitting this BUG_ON caused a recursive oops (because oops
    handling involves do_exit(), which calls into the scheduler, which in
    turn raises an oops), which caused stuff below the stack to be
    overwritten until a panic happened (e.g.  via an oops in interrupt
    context, caused by the overwritten CPU index in the thread_info).
    
    Just panic directly.

    x86/mm: Add barriers and document switch_mm()-vs-flush synchronization
    
    When switch_mm() activates a new PGD, it also sets a bit that
    tells other CPUs that the PGD is in use so that TLB flush IPIs
    will be sent.  In order for that to work correctly, the bit
    needs to be visible prior to loading the PGD and therefore
    starting to fill the local TLB.
    
    Document all the barriers that make this work correctly and add
    a couple that were missing.

    atl2: Disable unimplemented scatter/gather feature
    
    atl2 includes NETIF_F_SG in hw_features even though it has no support
    for non-linear skbs.  This bug was originally harmless since the
    driver does not claim to implement checksum offload and that used to
    be a requirement for SG.
    
    Now that SG and checksum offload are independent features, if you
    explicitly enable SG *and* use one of the rare protocols that can use
    SG without checkusm offload, this potentially leaks sensitive
    information (before you notice that it just isn't working).  Therefore
    this obscure bug has been designated CVE-2016-2117.

    s390/mm: four page table levels vs. fork
    
    The fork of a process with four page table levels is broken since
    git commit 6252d702c5311ce9 "[S390] dynamic page tables."
    
    All new mm contexts are created with three page table levels and
    an asce limit of 4TB. If the parent has four levels dup_mmap will
    add vmas to the new context which are outside of the asce limit.
    The subsequent call to copy_page_range will walk the three level
    page table structure of the new process with non-zero pgd and pud
    indexes. This leads to memory clobbers as the pgd_index *and* the
    pud_index is added to the mm->pgd pointer without a pgd_deref
    in between.
    
    The init_new_context() function is selecting the number of page
    table levels for a new context. The function is used by mm_init()
    which in turn is called by dup_mm() and mm_alloc(). These two are
    used by fork() and exec(). The init_new_context() function can
    distinguish the two cases by looking at mm->context.asce_limit,
    for fork() the mm struct has been copied and the number of page
    table levels may not change. For exec() the mm_alloc() function
    set the new mm structure to zero, in this case a three-level page
    table is created as the temporary stack space is located at
    STACK_TOP_MAX = 4TB.
    
    This fixes CVE-2016-2143.

    ALSA: seq: Fix race at timer setup and close
    
    ALSA sequencer code has an open race between the timer setup ioctl and
    the close of the client.  This was triggered by syzkaller fuzzer, and
    a use-after-free was caught there as a result.
    
    This patch papers over it by adding a proper queue->timer_mutex lock
    around the timer-related calls in the relevant code path.

    ALSA: timer: Fix double unlink of active_list
    
    ALSA timer instance object has a couple of linked lists and they are
    unlinked unconditionally at snd_timer_stop().  Meanwhile
    snd_timer_interrupt() unlinks it, but it calls list_del() which leaves
    the element list itself unchanged.  This ends up with unlinking twice,
    and it was caught by syzkaller fuzzer.
    
    The fix is to use list_del_init() variant properly there, too.

    ALSA: timer: Fix race among timer ioctls
    
    ALSA timer ioctls have an open race and this may lead to a
    use-after-free of timer instance object.  A simplistic fix is to make
    each ioctl exclusive.  We have already tread_sem for controlling the
    tread, and extend this as a global mutex to be applied to each ioctl.
    
    The downside is, of course, the worse concurrency.  But these ioctls
    aren't to be parallel accessible, in anyway, so it should be fine to
    serialize there.

    ALSA: timer: Harden slave timer list handling
    
    A slave timer instance might be still accessible in a racy way while
    operating the master instance as it lacks of locking.  Since the
    master operation is mostly protected with timer->lock, we should cope
    with it while changing the slave instance, too.  Also, some linked
    lists (active_list and ack_list) of slave instances aren't unlinked
    immediately at stopping or closing, and this may lead to unexpected
    accesses.
    
    This patch tries to address these issues.  It adds spin lock of
    timer->lock (either from master or slave, which is equivalent) in a
    few places.  For avoiding a deadlock, we ensure that the global
    slave_active_lock is always locked at first before each timer lock.
    
    Also, ack and active_list of slave instances are properly unlinked at
    snd_timer_stop() and snd_timer_close().
    
    Last but not least, remove the superfluous call of _snd_timer_stop()
    at removing slave links.  This is a noop, and calling it may confuse
    readers wrt locking.  Further cleanup will follow in a later patch.
    
    Actually we've got reports of use-after-free by syzkaller fuzzer, and
    this hopefully fixes these issues.

    ALSA: hrtimer: Fix stall by hrtimer_cancel()
    
    hrtimer_cancel() waits for the completion from the callback, thus it
    must not be called inside the callback itself.  This was already a
    problem in the past with ALSA hrtimer driver, and the early commit
    [fcfdebe70759: ALSA: hrtimer - Fix lock-up] tried to address it.
    
    However, the previous fix is still insufficient: it may still cause a
    lockup when the ALSA timer instance reprograms itself in its callback.
    Then it invokes the start function even in snd_timer_interrupt() that
    is called in hrtimer callback itself, results in a CPU stall.  This is
    no hypothetical problem but actually triggered by syzkaller fuzzer.
    
    This patch tries to fix the issue again.  Now we call
    hrtimer_try_to_cancel() at both start and stop functions so that it
    won't fall into a deadlock, yet giving some chance to cancel the queue
    if the functions have been called outside the callback.  The proper
    hrtimer_cancel() is called in anyway at closing, so this should be
    enough.

    unix: correctly track in-flight fds in sending process user_struct
    
    The commit referenced in the Fixes tag incorrectly accounted the number
    of in-flight fds over a unix domain socket to the original opener
    of the file-descriptor. This allows another process to arbitrary
    deplete the original file-openers resource limit for the maximum of
    open files. Instead the sending processes and its struct cred should
    be credited.
    
    To do so, we add a reference counted struct user_struct pointer to the
    scm_fp_list and use it to account for the number of inflight unix fds.

    pipe: limit the per-user amount of pages allocated in pipes
    
    On no-so-small systems, it is possible for a single process to cause an
    OOM condition by filling large pipes with data that are never read. A
    typical process filling 4000 pipes with 1 MB of data will use 4 GB of
    memory. On small systems it may be tricky to set the pipe max size to
    prevent this from happening.
    
    This patch makes it possible to enforce a per-user soft limit above
    which new pipes will be limited to a single page, effectively limiting
    them to 4 kB each, as well as a hard limit above which no new pipes may
    be created for this user. This has the effect of protecting the system
    against memory abuse without hurting other users, and still allowing
    pipes to work correctly though with less data at once.
    
    The limit are controlled by two new sysctls : pipe-user-pages-soft, and
    pipe-user-pages-hard. Both may be disabled by setting them to zero. The
    default soft limit allows the default number of FDs per process (1024)
    to create pipes of the default size (64kB), thus reaching a limit of 64MB
    before starting to create only smaller pipes. With 256 processes limited
    to 1024 FDs each, this results in 1024*64kB + (256*1024 - 1024) * 4kB =
    1084 MB of memory allocated for a user. The hard limit is disabled by
    default to avoid breaking existing applications that make intensive use
    of pipes (eg: for splicing).

Author: Florian Westphal <fw@strlen.de>
Date:   Tue Mar 22 18:02:52 2016 +0100

    netfilter: x_tables: fix unconditional helper
    
    Ben Hawkes says:
    
     In the mark_source_chains function (net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_tables.c) it
     is possible for a user-supplied ipt_entry structure to have a large
     next_offset field. This field is not bounds checked prior to writing a
     counter value at the supplied offset.
    
    Problem is that mark_source_chains should not have been called --
    the rule doesn't have a next entry, so its supposed to return
    an absolute verdict of either ACCEPT or DROP.
    
    However, the function conditional() doesn't work as the name implies.
    It only checks that the rule is using wildcard address matching.
    
    However, an unconditional rule must also not be using any matches
    (no -m args).
    
    The underflow validator only checked the addresses, therefore
    passing the 'unconditional absolute verdict' test, while
    mark_source_chains also tested for presence of matches, and thus
    proceeeded to the next (not-existent) rule.
    
    Unify this so that all the callers have same idea of 'unconditional rule'.

    ipv4: Don't do expensive useless work during inetdev destroy.
    
    When an inetdev is destroyed, every address assigned to the interface
    is removed.  And in this scenerio we do two pointless things which can
    be very expensive if the number of assigned interfaces is large:
    
    1) Address promotion.  We are deleting all addresses, so there is no
       point in doing this.
    
    2) A full nf conntrack table purge for every address.  We only need to
       do this once, as is already caught by the existing
       masq_dev_notifier so masq_inet_event() can skip this.

    x86/iopl/64: Properly context-switch IOPL on Xen PV
    
    On Xen PV, regs->flags doesn't reliably reflect IOPL and the
    exit-to-userspace code doesn't change IOPL.  We need to context
    switch it manually.
    
    I'm doing this without going through paravirt because this is
    specific to Xen PV.  After the dust settles, we can merge this with
    the 32-bit code, tidy up the iopl syscall implementation, and remove
    the set_iopl pvop entirely.
    
    Fixes XSA-171.

commit 8b8addf891de8a00e4d39fc32f93f7c5eb8feceb
Author: Hector Marco-Gisbert <hecmargi@upv.es>
Date:   Thu Mar 10 20:51:00 2016 +0100

    x86/mm/32: Enable full randomization on i386 and X86_32
    
    Currently on i386 and on X86_64 when emulating X86_32 in legacy mode, only
    the stack and the executable are randomized but not other mmapped files
    (libraries, vDSO, etc.). This patch enables randomization for the
    libraries, vDSO and mmap requests on i386 and in X86_32 in legacy mode.
    
    By default on i386 there are 8 bits for the randomization of the libraries,
    vDSO and mmaps which only uses 1MB of VA.
    
    This patch preserves the original randomness, using 1MB of VA out of 3GB or
    4GB. We think that 1MB out of 3GB is not a big cost for having the ASLR.
    
    The first obvious security benefit is that all objects are randomized (not
    only the stack and the executable) in legacy mode which highly increases
    the ASLR effectiveness, otherwise the attackers may use these
    non-randomized areas. But also sensitive setuid/setgid applications are
    more secure because currently, attackers can disable the randomization of
    these applications by setting the ulimit stack to "unlimited". This is a
    very old and widely known trick to disable the ASLR in i386 which has been
    allowed for too long.
    
    Another trick used to disable the ASLR was to set the ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE
    personality flag, but fortunately this doesn't work on setuid/setgid
    applications because there is security checks which clear Security-relevant
    flags.
    
    This patch always randomizes the mmap_legacy_base address, removing the
    possibility to disable the ASLR by setting the stack to "unlimited".

    KVM: MTRR: remove MSR 0x2f8
    
    MSR 0x2f8 accessed the 124th Variable Range MTRR ever since MTRR support
    was introduced by 9ba075a664df ("KVM: MTRR support").
    
    0x2f8 became harmful when 910a6aae4e2e ("KVM: MTRR: exactly define the
    size of variable MTRRs") shrinked the array of VR MTRRs from 256 to 8,
    which made access to index 124 out of bounds.  The surrounding code only
    WARNs in this situation, thus the guest gained a limited read/write
    access to struct kvm_arch_vcpu.
    
    0x2f8 is not a valid VR MTRR MSR, because KVM has/advertises only 16 VR
    MTRR MSRs, 0x200-0x20f.  Every VR MTRR is set up using two MSRs, 0x2f8
    was treated as a PHYSBASE and 0x2f9 would be its PHYSMASK, but 0x2f9 was
    not implemented in KVM, therefore 0x2f8 could never do anything useful
    and getting rid of it is safe.
    
    This fixes CVE-2016-3713.

    cdc_ncm: do not call usbnet_link_change from cdc_ncm_bind
    
    usbnet_link_change will call schedule_work and should be
    avoided if bind is failing. Otherwise we will end up with
    scheduled work referring to a netdev which has gone away.
    
    Instead of making the call conditional, we can just defer
    it to usbnet_probe, using the driver_info flag made for
    this purpose.

    x86/mm/xen: Suppress hugetlbfs in PV guests
    
    Huge pages are not normally available to PV guests. Not suppressing
    hugetlbfs use results in an endless loop of page faults when user mode

    denies such PTEs to be created, but error indications can't be
    propagated out of xen_set_pte_at(), just like for various of its
    siblings), and - once killed in an oops like this:

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 3ce424e45411cf5a13105e0386b6ecf6eeb4f66f

    kvm:vmx: more complete state update on APICv on/off
    
    The function to update APICv on/off state (in particular, to deactivate
    it when enabling Hyper-V SynIC) is incomplete: it doesn't adjust
    APICv-related fields among secondary processor-based VM-execution
    controls.  As a result, Windows 2012 guests get stuck when SynIC-based
    auto-EOI interrupt intersected with e.g. an IPI in the guest.
    
    In addition, the MSR intercept bitmap isn't updated every time "virtualize
    x2APIC mode" is toggled.  This path can only be triggered by a malicious
    guest, because Windows didn't use x2APIC but rather their own synthetic
    APIC access MSRs; however a guest running in a SynIC-enabled VM could
    switch to x2APIC and thus obtain direct access to host APIC MSRs
    (CVE-2016-4440).
    
    The patch fixes those omissions.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 38327424b40bcebe2de92d07312c89360ac9229a
Author: Dan Carpenter <dan.carpenter@oracle.com>
Date:   Thu Jun 16 15:48:57 2016 +0100

    KEYS: potential uninitialized variable
    
    If __key_link_begin() failed then "edit" would be uninitialized.  I've
    added a check to fix that.
    
    This allows a random user to crash the kernel, though it's quite
    difficult to achieve.  There are three ways it can be done as the user
    would have to cause an error to occur in __key_link():
    
     (1) Cause the kernel to run out of memory.  In practice, this is difficult
         to achieve without ENOMEM cropping up elsewhere and aborting the
         attempt.
    
     (2) Revoke the destination keyring between the keyring ID being looked up
         and it being tested for revocation.  In practice, this is difficult to
         time correctly because the KEYCTL_REJECT function can only be used
         from the request-key upcall process.  Further, users can only make use
         of what's in /sbin/request-key.conf, though this does including a
         rejection debugging test - which means that the destination keyring
         has to be the caller's session keyring in practice.
    
     (3) Have just enough key quota available to create a key, a new session
         keyring for the upcall and a link in the session keyring, but not then
         sufficient quota to create a link in the nominated destination keyring
         so that it fails with EDQUOT.
    
    The bug can be triggered using option (3) above using something like the
    following:
    
    	echo 80 >/proc/sys/kernel/keys/root_maxbytes
    	keyctl request2 user debug:fred negate @t
    
    The above sets the quota to something much lower (80) to make the bug
    easier to trigger, but this is dependent on the system.  Note also that
    the name of the keyring created contains a random number that may be
    between 1 and 10 characters in size, so may throw the test off by
    changing the amount of quota used.
    
    Assuming the failure occurs, something like the following will be seen:
    
    	kfree_debugcheck: out of range ptr 6b6b6b6b6b6b6b68h
    	------------[ cut here ]------------

    bpf: fix double-fdput in replace_map_fd_with_map_ptr()
    
    When bpf(BPF_PROG_LOAD, ...) was invoked with a BPF program whose bytecode
    references a non-map file descriptor as a map file descriptor, the error
    handling code called fdput() twice instead of once (in __bpf_map_get() and
    in replace_map_fd_with_map_ptr()). If the file descriptor table of the
    current task is shared, this causes f_count to be decremented too much,
    allowing the struct file to be freed while it is still in use
    (use-after-free). This can be exploited to gain root privileges by an
    unprivileged user.
    
    This bug was introduced in
    commit 0246e64d9a5f ("bpf: handle pseudo BPF_LD_IMM64 insn"), but is only
    exploitable since
    commit 1be7f75d1668 ("bpf: enable non-root eBPF programs") because
    previously, CAP_SYS_ADMIN was required to reach the vulnerable code.

    IB/security: Restrict use of the write() interface
    
    The drivers/infiniband stack uses write() as a replacement for
    bi-directional ioctl().  This is not safe. There are ways to
    trigger write calls that result in the return structure that
    is normally written to user space being shunted off to user
    specified kernel memory instead.
    
    For the immediate repair, detect and deny suspicious accesses to
    the write API.
    
    For long term, update the user space libraries and the kernel API
    to something that doesn't present the same security vulnerabilities
    (likely a structured ioctl() interface).
    
    The impacted uAPI interfaces are generally only available if
    hardware from drivers/infiniband is installed in the system.

    net: fix a kernel infoleak in x25 module
    
    Stack object "dte_facilities" is allocated in x25_rx_call_request(),
    which is supposed to be initialized in x25_negotiate_facilities.
    However, 5 fields (8 bytes in total) are not initialized. This
    object is then copied to userland via copy_to_user, thus infoleak
    occurs.

    percpu: fix synchronization between synchronous map extension and chunk destruction
    
    For non-atomic allocations, pcpu_alloc() can try to extend the area
    map synchronously after dropping pcpu_lock; however, the extension
    wasn't synchronized against chunk destruction and the chunk might get
    freed while extension is in progress.
    
    This patch fixes the bug by putting most of non-atomic allocations
    under pcpu_alloc_mutex to synchronize against pcpu_balance_work which
    is responsible for async chunk management including destruction.

    percpu: fix synchronization between chunk->map_extend_work and chunk destruction
    
    Atomic allocations can trigger async map extensions which is serviced
    by chunk->map_extend_work.  pcpu_balance_work which is responsible for
    destroying idle chunks wasn't synchronizing properly against
    chunk->map_extend_work and may end up freeing the chunk while the work
    item is still in flight.
    
    This patch fixes the bug by rolling async map extension operations
    into pcpu_balance_work.

    ppp: take reference on channels netns
    
    Let channels hold a reference on their network namespace.
    Some channel types, like ppp_async and ppp_synctty, can have their
    userspace controller running in a different namespace. Therefore they
    can't rely on them to preclude their netns from being removed from
    under them.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 99d825822eade8d827a1817357cbf3f889a552d6
Author: Al Viro <viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk>
Date:   Thu May 5 16:25:35 2016 -0400

    get_rock_ridge_filename(): handle malformed NM entries
    
    Payloads of NM entries are not supposed to contain NUL.  When we run
    into such, only the part prior to the first NUL goes into the
    concatenation (i.e. the directory entry name being encoded by a bunch
    of NM entries).  We do stop when the amount collected so far + the
    claimed amount in the current NM entry exceed 254.  So far, so good,
    but what we return as the total length is the sum of *claimed*
    sizes, not the actual amount collected.  And that can grow pretty
    large - not unlimited, since you'd need to put CE entries in
    between to be able to get more than the maximum that could be
    contained in one isofs directory entry / continuation chunk and
    we are stop once we'd encountered 32 CEs, but you can get about 8Kb
    easily.  And that's what will be passed to readdir callback as the
    name length.  8Kb __copy_to_user() from a buffer allocated by
    __get_free_page()

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 19be0eaffa3ac7d8eb6784ad9bdbc7d67ed8e619
Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>
Date:   Thu Oct 13 13:07:36 2016 -0700

    mm: remove gup_flags FOLL_WRITE games from __get_user_pages()
    
    This is an ancient bug that was actually attempted to be fixed once
    (badly) by me eleven years ago in commit 4ceb5db9757a ("Fix
    get_user_pages() race for write access") but that was then undone due to
    problems on s390 by commit f33ea7f404e5 ("fix get_user_pages bug").
    
    In the meantime, the s390 situation has long been fixed, and we can now
    fix it by checking the pte_dirty() bit properly (and do it better).  The
    s390 dirty bit was implemented in abf09bed3cce ("s390/mm: implement
    software dirty bits") which made it into v3.9.  Earlier kernels will
    have to look at the page state itself.
    
    Also, the VM has become more scalable, and what used a purely
    theoretical race back then has become easier to trigger.
    
    To fix it, we introduce a new internal FOLL_COW flag to mark the "yes,
    we already did a COW" rather than play racy games with FOLL_WRITE that
    is very fundamental, and then use the pte dirty flag to validate that
    the FOLL_COW flag is still valid.

    media: fix airspy usb probe error path
    
    Fix a memory leak on probe error of the airspy usb device driver.
    
    The problem is triggered when more than 64 usb devices register with
    v4l2 of type VFL_TYPE_SDR or VFL_TYPE_SUBDEV.
    
    The memory leak is caused by the probe function of the airspy driver
    mishandeling errors and not freeing the corresponding control structures
    when an error occours registering the device to v4l2 core.
    
    A badusb device can emulate 64 of these devices, and then through
    continual emulated connect/disconnect of the 65th device, cause the
    kernel to run out of RAM and crash the kernel, thus causing a local DOS
    vulnerability.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 93d17397e4e2182fdaad503e2f9da46202c0f1c3
Author: Paul Mackerras <paulus@ozlabs.org>
Date:   Wed Jun 22 15:52:55 2016 +1000

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Save/restore TM state in H_CEDE
    
    It turns out that if the guest does a H_CEDE while the CPU is in
    a transactional state, and the H_CEDE does a nap, and the nap
    loses the architected state of the CPU (which is is allowed to do),
    then we lose the checkpointed state of the virtual CPU.  In addition,
    the transactional-memory state recorded in the MSR gets reset back
    to non-transactional, and when we try to return to the guest, we take
    a TM bad thing type of program interrupt because we are trying to
    transition from non-transactional to transactional with a hrfid
    instruction, which is not permitted.
    
    The result of the program interrupt occurring at that point is that
    the host CPU will hang in an infinite loop with interrupts disabled.
    Thus this is a denial of service vulnerability in the host which can
    be triggered by any guest (and depending on the guest kernel, it can
    potentially triggered by unprivileged userspace in the guest).
    
    This vulnerability has been assigned the ID CVE-2016-5412.
    
    To fix this, we save the TM state before napping and restore it
    on exit from the nap, when handling a H_CEDE in real mode.  The
    case where H_CEDE exits to host virtual mode is already OK (as are
    other hcalls which exit to host virtual mode) because the exit
    path saves the TM state.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Pull out TM state save/restore into separate procedures
    
    This moves the transactional memory state save and restore sequences
    out of the guest entry/exit paths into separate procedures.  This is
    so that these sequences can be used in going into and out of nap
    in a subsequent patch.
    
    The only code changes here are (a) saving and restore LR on the
    stack, since these new procedures get called with a bl instruction,
    (b) explicitly saving r1 into the PACA instead of assuming that
    HSTATE_HOST_R1(r13) is already set, and (c) removing an unnecessary
    and redundant setting of MSR[TM] that should have been removed by
    commit 9d4d0bdd9e0a ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Add transactional memory
    support", 2013-09-24) but wasn't.

    tcp: make challenge acks less predictable
    
    Yue Cao claims that current host rate limiting of challenge ACKS
    (RFC 5961) could leak enough information to allow a patient attacker
    to hijack TCP sessions. He will soon provide details in an academic
    paper.
    
    This patch increases the default limit from 100 to 1000, and adds
    some randomization so that the attacker can no longer hijack
    sessions without spending a considerable amount of probes.
    
    Based on initial analysis and patch from Linus.
    
    Note that we also have per socket rate limiting, so it is tempting
    to remove the host limit in the future.
    
    v2: randomize the count of challenge acks per second, not the period.

    misc: mic: Fix for double fetch security bug in VOP driver
    
    The MIC VOP driver does two successive reads from user space to read a
    variable length data structure. Kernel memory corruption can result if
    the data structure changes between the two reads. This patch disallows
    the chance of this happening.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 8e96a87c5431c256feb65bcfc5aec92d9f7839b6
Author: Cyril Bur <cyrilbur@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Jun 17 14:58:34 2016 +1000

    powerpc/tm: Always reclaim in start_thread() for exec() class syscalls
    
    Userspace can quite legitimately perform an exec() syscall with a
    suspended transaction. exec() does not return to the old process, rather
    it load a new one and starts that, the expectation therefore is that the
    new process starts not in a transaction. Currently exec() is not treated
    any differently to any other syscall which creates problems.
    
    Firstly it could allow a new process to start with a suspended
    transaction for a binary that no longer exists. This means that the
    checkpointed state won't be valid and if the suspended transaction were
    ever to be resumed and subsequently aborted (a possibility which is
    exceedingly likely as exec()ing will likely doom the transaction) the
    new process will jump to invalid state.
    
    Secondly the incorrect attempt to keep the transactional state while
    still zeroing state for the new process creates at least two TM Bad
    Things. The first triggers on the rfid to return to userspace as
    start_thread() has given the new process a 'clean' MSR but the suspend
    will still be set in the hardware MSR. The second TM Bad Thing triggers
    in __switch_to() as the processor is still transactionally suspended but
    __switch_to() wants to zero the TM sprs for the new process.
    
    This is an example of the outcome of calling exec() with a suspended
    transaction. Note the first 700 is likely the first TM bad thing
    decsribed earlier only the kernel can't report it as we've loaded
    userspace registers. c000000000009980 is the rfid in
    fast_exception_return()

    s390/sclp_ctl: fix potential information leak with /dev/sclp
    
    The sclp_ctl_ioctl_sccb function uses two copy_from_user calls to
    retrieve the sclp request from user space. The first copy_from_user
    fetches the length of the request which is stored in the first two
    bytes of the request. The second copy_from_user gets the complete
    sclp request, but this copies the length field a second time.
    A malicious user may have changed the length in the meantime.

    where we first check the execve(2) argumnets for any "bad" characters
    which would require hex encoding and then re-fetch the arguments for
    logging in the audit record[1].  Of course this leaves a window of
    opportunity for an unsavory application to munge with the data.
    
    This patch reworks things by only fetching the argument data once[2]
    into a buffer where it is scanned and logged into the audit
    records(s).  In addition to fixing the double fetch, this patch
    improves on the original code in a few other ways: better handling
    of large arguments which require encoding, stricter record length
    checking, and some performance improvements (completely unverified,
    but we got rid of some strlen() calls, that's got to be a good
    thing).
    
    As part of the development of this patch, I've also created a basic
    regression test for the audit-testsuite, the test can be tracked on
    GitHub at the following link:
    
     * https://github.com/linux-audit/audit-testsuite/issues/25
    
    [1] If you pay careful attention, there is actually a triple fetch
    problem due to a strnlen_user() call at the top of the function.
    
    [2] This is a tiny white lie, we do make a call to strnlen_user()
    prior to fetching the argument data.  I don't like it, but due to the
    way the audit record is structured we really have no choice unless we
    copy the entire argument at once (which would require a rather
    wasteful allocation).  The good news is that with this patch the
    kernel no longer relies on this strnlen_user() value for anything
    beyond recording it in the log, we also update it with a trustworthy
    value whenever possible.

    platform/chrome: cros_ec_dev - double fetch bug in ioctl
    
    We verify "u_cmd.outsize" and "u_cmd.insize" but we need to make sure
    that those values have not changed between the two copy_from_user()
    calls.  Otherwise it could lead to a buffer overflow.
    
    Additionally, cros_ec_cmd_xfer() can set s_cmd->insize to a lower value.
    We should use the new smaller value so we don't copy too much data to
    the user.

    apparmor: fix oops, validate buffer size in apparmor_setprocattr()
    
    When proc_pid_attr_write() was changed to use memdup_user apparmor's
    (interface violating) assumption that the setprocattr buffer was always
    a single page was violated.
    
    The size test is not strictly speaking needed as proc_pid_attr_write()
    will reject anything larger, but for the sake of robustness we can keep
    it in.
    
    SMACK and SELinux look safe to me, but somebody else should probably
    have a look just in case.

    ovl: verify upper dentry before unlink and rename
    
    Unlink and rename in overlayfs checked the upper dentry for staleness by
    verifying upper->d_parent against upperdir.  However the dentry can go
    stale also by being unhashed, for example.
    
    Expand the verification to actually look up the name again (under parent
    lock) and check if it matches the upper dentry.  This matches what the VFS
    does before passing the dentry to filesytem's unlink/rename methods, which
    excludes any inconsistency caused by overlayfs.

    vfs: rename: check backing inode being equal
    
    If a file is renamed to a hardlink of itself POSIX specifies that rename(2)
    should do nothing and return success.
    
    This condition is checked in vfs_rename().  However it won't detect hard
    links on overlayfs where these are given separate inodes on the overlayfs
    layer.
    
    Overlayfs itself detects this condition and returns success without doing
    anything, but then vfs_rename() will proceed as if this was a successful
    rename (detach_mounts(), d_move()).
    
    The correct thing to do is to detect this condition before even calling
    into overlayfs.  This patch does this by calling vfs_select_inode() to get
    the underlying inodes.

    aacraid: Check size values after double-fetch from user
    
    In aacraid's ioctl_send_fib() we do two fetches from userspace, one the
    get the fib header's size and one for the fib itself. Later we use the
    size field from the second fetch to further process the fib. If for some
    reason the size from the second fetch is different than from the first
    fix, we may encounter an out-of- bounds access in aac_fib_send(). We
    also check the sender size to insure it is not out of bounds. This was

Date:   Wed Aug 17 05:56:26 2016 -0700

    tcp: fix use after free in tcp_xmit_retransmit_queue()
    
    When tcp_sendmsg() allocates a fresh and empty skb, it puts it at the
    tail of the write queue using tcp_add_write_queue_tail()
    
    Then it attempts to copy user data into this fresh skb.
    
    If the copy fails, we undo the work and remove the fresh skb.
    
    Unfortunately, this undo lacks the change done to tp->highest_sack and
    we can leave a dangling pointer (to a freed skb)
    
    Later, tcp_xmit_retransmit_queue() can dereference this pointer and
    access freed memory. For regular kernels where memory is not unmapped,
    this might cause SACK bugs because tcp_highest_sack_seq() is buggy,
    returning garbage instead of tp->snd_nxt, but with various debug
    features like CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC, this can crash the kernel.
    
    This bug was found by Marco Grassi thanks to syzkaller.

    posix_acl: Clear SGID bit when setting file permissions
    
    When file permissions are modified via chmod(2) and the user is not in
    the owning group or capable of CAP_FSETID, the setgid bit is cleared in
    inode_change_ok().  Setting a POSIX ACL via setxattr(2) sets the file
    permissions as well as the new ACL, but doesn't clear the setgid bit in
    a similar way; this allows to bypass the check in chmod(2).  Fix that.

    net: Fix use after free in the recvmmsg exit path
    
    The syzkaller fuzzer hit the following use-after-free:
    
      Call Trace:
       [<ffffffff8175ea0e>] __asan_report_load8_noabort+0x3e/0x40 mm/kasan/report.c:295
       [<ffffffff851cc31a>] __sys_recvmmsg+0x6fa/0x7f0 net/socket.c:2261

      arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:185
    
    And, as Dmitry rightly assessed, that is because we can drop the
    reference and then touch it when the underlying recvmsg calls return
    some packets and then hit an error, which will make recvmmsg to set
    sock->sk->sk_err, oops, fix it.

    brcmfmac: avoid potential stack overflow in brcmf_cfg80211_start_ap()
    
    User-space can choose to omit NL80211_ATTR_SSID and only provide raw
    IE TLV data. When doing so it can provide SSID IE with length exceeding
    the allowed size. The driver further processes this IE copying it
    into a local variable without checking the length. Hence stack can be
    corrupted and used as exploit.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit fac8e0f579695a3ecbc4d3cac369139d7f819971
Author: Jesse Gross <jesse@kernel.org>

    tunnels: Don't apply GRO to multiple layers of encapsulation.
    
    When drivers express support for TSO of encapsulated packets, they
    only mean that they can do it for one layer of encapsulation.
    Supporting additional levels would mean updating, at a minimum,
    more IP length fields and they are unaware of this.
    
    No encapsulation device expresses support for handling offloaded
    encapsulated packets, so we won't generate these types of frames
    in the transmit path. However, GRO doesn't have a check for
    multiple levels of encapsulation and will attempt to build them.
    
    UDP tunnel GRO actually does prevent this situation but it only
    handles multiple UDP tunnels stacked on top of each other. This
    generalizes that solution to prevent any kind of tunnel stacking
    that would cause problems.
