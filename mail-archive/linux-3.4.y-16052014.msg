Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 6f7b0a2a5c0fb03be7c25bd1745baa50582348ef
Author: Darren Hart <dvhart@linux.intel.com>
Date:   Fri Jul 20 11:53:31 2012 -0700

    futex: Forbid uaddr == uaddr2 in futex_wait_requeue_pi()
    
    If uaddr == uaddr2, then we have broken the rule of only requeueing
    from a non-pi futex to a pi futex with this call. If we attempt this,
    as the trinity test suite manages to do, we miss early wakeups as
    q.key is equal to key2 (because they are the same uaddr). We will then
    attempt to dereference the pi_mutex (which would exist had the futex_q
    been properly requeued to a pi futex) and trigger a NULL pointer
    dereference.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 57e68e9cd65b4b8eb4045a1e0d0746458502554c
Author: Vlastimil Babka <vbabka@suse.cz>
Date:   Mon Apr 7 15:37:50 2014 -0700

    mm: try_to_unmap_cluster() should lock_page() before mlocking
    
    A BUG_ON(!PageLocked) was triggered in mlock_vma_page() by Sasha Levin
    fuzzing with trinity.  The call site try_to_unmap_cluster() does not lock
    the pages other than its check_page parameter (which is already locked).
    
    The BUG_ON in mlock_vma_page() is not documented and its purpose is
    somewhat unclear, but apparently it serializes against page migration,
    which could otherwise fail to transfer the PG_mlocked flag.  This would
    not be fatal, as the page would be eventually encountered again, but
    NR_MLOCK accounting would become distorted nevertheless.  This patch adds
    a comment to the BUG_ON in mlock_vma_page() and munlock_vma_page() to that
    effect.
    
    The call site try_to_unmap_cluster() is fixed so that for page !=
    check_page, trylock_page() is attempted (to avoid possible deadlocks as we
    already have check_page locked) and mlock_vma_page() is performed only
    upon success.  If the page lock cannot be obtained, the page is left
    without PG_mlocked, which is again not a problem in the whole unevictable
    memory design.
