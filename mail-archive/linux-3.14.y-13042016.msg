Description of fix for this vulnerability:

    ALSA: usb-audio: Add sanity checks for endpoint accesses
    
    Add some sanity check codes before actually accessing the endpoint via
    get_endpoint() in order to avoid the invalid access through a
    malformed USB descriptor.  Mostly just checking bNumEndpoints, but in
    one place (snd_microii_spdif_default_get()), the validity of iface and
    altsetting index is checked as well.

    USB: cdc-acm: more sanity checking
    
    An attack has become available which pretends to be a quirky
    device circumventing normal sanity checks and crashes the kernel
    by an insufficient number of interfaces. This patch adds a check
    to the code path for quirky devices.
