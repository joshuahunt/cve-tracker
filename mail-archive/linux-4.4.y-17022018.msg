    media: dvb-usb-v2: lmedm04: move ts2020 attach to dm04_lme2510_tuner
    
    When the tuner was split from m88rs2000 the attach function is in wrong
    place.
    
    Move to dm04_lme2510_tuner to trap errors on failure and removing
    a call to lme_coldreset.
    
    Prevents driver starting up without any tuner connected.
    
    Fixes to trap for ts2020 fail.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 43cdd1b716b26f6af16da4e145b6578f98798bf6
Author: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>
Date:   Fri Jan 19 10:06:03 2018 +0100

    ACPI: sbshc: remove raw pointer from printk() message
    
    There's no need to be printing a raw kernel pointer to the kernel log at
    every boot.  So just remove it, and change the whole message to use the
    correct dev_info() call at the same time.
