Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 9de4ee40547fd315d4a0ed1dd15a2fa3559ad707
Author: Dan Carpenter <dan.carpenter@oracle.com>
Date:   Wed Apr 18 12:51:31 2018 +0300

    cdrom: information leak in cdrom_ioctl_media_changed()
    
    This cast is wrong.  "cdi->capacity" is an int and "arg" is an unsigned
    long.  The way the check is written now, if one of the high 32 bits is
    set then we could read outside the info->slots[] array.
    
    This bug is pretty old and it predates git.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 67f93df79aeefc3add4e4b31a752600f834236e2
Author: Alexey Kodanev <alexey.kodanev@oracle.com>
Date:   Tue Mar 6 22:57:01 2018 +0300

    dccp: check sk for closed state in dccp_sendmsg()
    
    dccp_disconnect() sets 'dp->dccps_hc_tx_ccid' tx handler to NULL,
    therefore if DCCP socket is disconnected and dccp_sendmsg() is
    called after it, it will cause a NULL pointer dereference in
    dccp_write_xmit().
    
    This crash and the reproducer was reported by syzbot. Looks like
    it is reproduced if commit 69c64866ce07 ("dccp: CVE-2017-8824:
    use-after-free in DCCP code") is applied.
