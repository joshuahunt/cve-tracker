    net/packet: fix overflow in check for priv area size
    
    Subtracting tp_sizeof_priv from tp_block_size and casting to int
    to check whether one is less then the other doesn't always work
    (both of them are unsigned ints).
    
    Compare them as is instead.
    
    Also cast tp_sizeof_priv to u64 before using BLK_PLUS_PRIV, as
    it can overflow inside BLK_PLUS_PRIV otherwise.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit a4866aa812518ed1a37d8ea0c881dc946409de94
Author: Kees Cook <keescook@chromium.org>
Date:   Wed Apr 5 09:39:08 2017 -0700

    mm: Tighten x86 /dev/mem with zeroing reads
    
    Under CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM, reading System RAM through /dev/mem is
    disallowed. However, on x86, the first 1MB was always allowed for BIOS
    and similar things, regardless of it actually being System RAM. It was
    possible for heap to end up getting allocated in low 1MB RAM, and then
    read by things like x86info or dd, which would trip hardened usercopy:
    
    usercopy: kernel memory exposure attempt detected from ffff880000090000 (dma-kmalloc-256) (4096 bytes)
    
    This changes the x86 exception for the low 1MB by reading back zeros for
    System RAM areas instead of blindly allowing them. More work is needed to
    extend this to mmap, but currently mmap doesn't go through usercopy, so
    hardened usercopy won't Oops the kernel.
