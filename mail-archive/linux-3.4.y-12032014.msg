Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 08dff7b7d629807dbb1f398c68dd9cd58dd657a1

    mm/hotplug: correctly add new zone to all other nodes' zone lists
    
    When online_pages() is called to add new memory to an empty zone, it
    rebuilds all zone lists by calling build_all_zonelists().  But there's a
    bug which prevents the new zone to be added to other nodes' zone lists.
    
    online_pages() {
    	build_all_zonelists()
    	.....
    	node_set_state(zone_to_nid(zone), N_HIGH_MEMORY)
    }
    
    Here the node of the zone is put into N_HIGH_MEMORY state after calling
    build_all_zonelists(), but build_all_zonelists() only adds zones from
    nodes in N_HIGH_MEMORY state to the fallback zone lists.
    build_all_zonelists()
    
        ->__build_all_zonelists()
    	->build_zonelists()
    	    ->find_next_best_node()
    		->for_each_node_state(n, N_HIGH_MEMORY)
    
    So memory in the new zone will never be used by other nodes, and it may
    cause strange behavor when system is under memory pressure.  So put node
    into N_HIGH_MEMORY state before calling build_all_zonelists().
