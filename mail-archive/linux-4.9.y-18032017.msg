Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 040757f738e13caaa9c5078bca79aa97e11dde88
Author: Eric W. Biederman <ebiederm@xmission.com>
Date:   Sun Mar 5 15:03:22 2017 -0600

    ucount: Remove the atomicity from ucount->count
    
    Always increment/decrement ucount->count under the ucounts_lock.  The
    increments are there already and moving the decrements there means the
    locking logic of the code is simpler.  This simplification in the
    locking logic fixes a race between put_ucounts and get_ucounts that
    could result in a use-after-free because the count could go zero then
    be found by get_ucounts and then be freed by put_ucounts.
    
    A bug presumably this one was found by a combination of syzkaller and
    KASAN.  JongWhan Kim reported the syzkaller failure and Dmitry Vyukov
    spotted the race in the code.
