Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 670ae9caaca467ea1bfd325cb2a5c98ba87f94ad
Author: Michael S. Tsirkin <mst@redhat.com>
Date:   Sat May 12 00:33:10 2018 +0300

    vhost: fix info leak due to uninitialized memory
    
    struct vhost_msg within struct vhost_msg_node is copied to userspace.
    Unfortunately it turns out on 64 bit systems vhost_msg has padding after
    type which gcc doesn't initialize, leaking 4 uninitialized bytes to
    userspace.
    
    This padding also unfortunately means 32 bit users of this interface are
    broken on a 64 bit kernel which will need to be fixed separately.
