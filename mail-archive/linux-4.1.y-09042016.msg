    USB: cdc-acm: more sanity checking
    
    An attack has become available which pretends to be a quirky
    device circumventing normal sanity checks and crashes the kernel
    by an insufficient number of interfaces. This patch adds a check
    to the code path for quirky devices.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit fbd40ea0180a2d328c5adc61414dc8bab9335ce2
Author: David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>

    ipv4: Don't do expensive useless work during inetdev destroy.
    
    When an inetdev is destroyed, every address assigned to the interface
    is removed.  And in this scenerio we do two pointless things which can
    be very expensive if the number of assigned interfaces is large:
    
    1) Address promotion.  We are deleting all addresses, so there is no
       point in doing this.
    
    2) A full nf conntrack table purge for every address.  We only need to
       do this once, as is already caught by the existing
       masq_dev_notifier so masq_inet_event() can skip this.
