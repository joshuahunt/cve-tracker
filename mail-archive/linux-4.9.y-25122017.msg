Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 95a762e2c8c942780948091f8f2a4f32fce1ac6f
Author: Jann Horn <jannh@google.com>
Date:   Mon Dec 18 20:11:54 2017 -0800

    bpf: fix incorrect sign extension in check_alu_op()
    
    Distinguish between
    BPF_ALU64|BPF_MOV|BPF_K (load 32-bit immediate, sign-extended to 64-bit)
    and BPF_ALU|BPF_MOV|BPF_K (load 32-bit immediate, zero-padded to 64-bit);
    only perform sign extension in the first case.
    
    Starting with v4.14, this is exploitable by unprivileged users as long as
    the unprivileged_bpf_disabled sysctl isn't set.
    
    Debian assigned CVE-2017-16995 for this issue.
    
    v3:
     - add CVE number (Ben Hutchings)

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 0c17d1d2c61936401f4702e1846e2c19b200f958
Author: Jann Horn <jannh@google.com>
Date:   Mon Dec 18 20:11:55 2017 -0800

    bpf: fix incorrect tracking of register size truncation
    
    Properly handle register truncation to a smaller size.
    
    The old code first mirrors the clearing of the high 32 bits in the bitwise
    tristate representation, which is correct. But then, it computes the new
    arithmetic bounds as the intersection between the old arithmetic bounds and
    the bounds resulting from the bitwise tristate representation. Therefore,
    when coerce_reg_to_32() is called on a number with bounds
    [0xffff'fff8, 0x1'0000'0007], the verifier computes
    [0xffff'fff8, 0xffff'ffff] as bounds of the truncated number.
    This is incorrect: The truncated number could also be in the range [0, 7],
    and no meaningful arithmetic bounds can be computed in that case apart from
    the obvious [0, 0xffff'ffff].
    
    Starting with v4.14, this is exploitable by unprivileged users as long as
    the unprivileged_bpf_disabled sysctl isn't set.
    
    Debian assigned CVE-2017-16996 for this issue.
    
    v2:
     - flip the mask during arithmetic bounds calculation (Ben Hutchings)
    v3:
     - add CVE number (Ben Hutchings)

    bpf: fix integer overflows
    
    There were various issues related to the limited size of integers used in
    the verifier:
     - `off + size` overflow in __check_map_access()
     - `off + reg->off` overflow in check_mem_access()
     - `off + reg->var_off.value` overflow or 32-bit truncation of
       `reg->var_off.value` in check_mem_access()
     - 32-bit truncation in check_stack_boundary()
    
    Make sure that any integer math cannot overflow by not allowing
    pointer math with large values.
    
    Also reduce the scope of "scalar op scalar" tracking.

    bpf: don't prune branches when a scalar is replaced with a pointer
    
    This could be made safe by passing through a reference to env and checking
    for env->allow_ptr_leaks, but it would only work one way and is probably
    not worth the hassle - not doing it will not directly lead to program
    rejection.

Author: Alexei Starovoitov <ast@fb.com>

    bpf: fix branch pruning logic
    
    when the verifier detects that register contains a runtime constant
    and it's compared with another constant it will prune exploration
    of the branch that is guaranteed not to be taken at runtime.
    This is all correct, but malicious program may be constructed
    in such a way that it always has a constant comparison and
    the other branch is never taken under any conditions.
    In this case such path through the program will not be explored
    by the verifier. It won't be taken at run-time either, but since
    all instructions are JITed the malicious program may cause JITs
    to complain about using reserved fields, etc.
    To fix the issue we have to track the instructions explored by
    the verifier and sanitize instructions that are dead at run time
    with NOPs. We cannot reject such dead code, since llvm generates
    it for valid C code, since it doesn't do as much data flow
    analysis as the verifier does.
