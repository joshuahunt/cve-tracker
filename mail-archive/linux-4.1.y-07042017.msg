Description of fix for this vulnerability:

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Sanitize special-purpose register values on guest exit
    
    Thomas Huth discovered that a guest could cause a hard hang of a
    host CPU by setting the Instruction Authority Mask Register (IAMR)
    to a suitable value.  It turns out that this is because when the
    code was added to context-switch the new special-purpose registers
    (SPRs) that were added in POWER8, we forgot to add code to ensure
    that they were restored to a sane value on guest exit.
    
    This adds code to set those registers where a bad value could
    compromise the execution of the host kernel to a suitable neutral
    value on guest exit.
