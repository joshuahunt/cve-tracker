Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 67f93df79aeefc3add4e4b31a752600f834236e2
Author: Alexey Kodanev <alexey.kodanev@oracle.com>
Date:   Tue Mar 6 22:57:01 2018 +0300

    dccp: check sk for closed state in dccp_sendmsg()
    
    dccp_disconnect() sets 'dp->dccps_hc_tx_ccid' tx handler to NULL,
    therefore if DCCP socket is disconnected and dccp_sendmsg() is
    called after it, it will cause a NULL pointer dereference in
    dccp_write_xmit().
    
    This crash and the reproducer was reported by syzbot. Looks like
    it is reproduced if commit 69c64866ce07 ("dccp: CVE-2017-8824:
    use-after-free in DCCP code") is applied.

    blkcg: fix double free of new_blkg in blkcg_init_queue
    
    If blkg_create fails, new_blkg passed as an argument will
    be freed by blkg_create, so there is no need to free it again.
