    scsi: libsas: direct call probe and destruct
    
    In commit 87c8331fcf72 ("[SCSI] libsas: prevent domain rediscovery
    competing with ata error handling") introduced disco mutex to prevent
    rediscovery competing with ata error handling and put the whole
    revalidation in the mutex. But the rphy add/remove needs to wait for the
    error handling which also grabs the disco mutex. This may leads to dead
    lock.So the probe and destruct event were introduce to do the rphy
    add/remove asynchronously and out of the lock.
    
    The asynchronously processed workers makes the whole discovery process
    not atomic, the other events may interrupt the process. For example,
    if a loss of signal event inserted before the probe event, the
    sas_deform_port() is called and the port will be deleted.
    
    And sas_port_delete() may run before the destruct event, but the
    port-x:x is the top parent of end device or expander. This leads to
    a kernel WARNING such as:
    
    [   82.042979] sysfs group 'power' not found for kobject 'phy-1:0:22'
    [   82.042983] ------------[ cut here ]------------

    Make probe and destruct a direct call in the disco and revalidate function,
    but put them outside the lock. The whole discovery or revalidate won't
    be interrupted by other events. And the DISCE_PROBE and DISCE_DESTRUCT
    event are deleted as a result of the direct call.
    
    Introduce a new list to destruct the sas_port and put the port delete after
    the destruct. This makes sure the right order of destroying the sysfs
    kobject and fix the warning above.
    
    In sas_ex_revalidate_domain() have a loop to find all broadcasted
    device, and sometimes we have a chance to find the same expander twice.
    Because the sas_port will be deleted at the end of the whole revalidate
    process, sas_port with the same name cannot be added before this.
    Otherwise the sysfs will complain of creating duplicate filename. Since
    the LLDD will send broadcast for every device change, we can only
    process one expander's revalidation.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 57ebd808a97d7c5b1e1afb937c2db22beba3c1f8
Author: Florian Westphal <fw@strlen.de>

    netfilter: add back stackpointer size checks
    
    The rationale for removing the check is only correct for rulesets
    generated by ip(6)tables.
    
    In iptables, a jump can only occur to a user-defined chain, i.e.
    because we size the stack based on number of user-defined chains we
    cannot exceed stack size.
    
    However, the underlying binary format has no such restriction,
    and the validation step only ensures that the jump target is a
    valid rule start point.
    
    IOW, its possible to build a rule blob that has no user-defined
    chains but does contain a jump.
    
    If this happens, no jump stack gets allocated and crash occurs
    because no jumpstack was allocated.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit b3b7c4795ccab5be71f080774c45bbbcc75c2aaf
Author: Seunghun Han <kkamagui@gmail.com>

    x86/MCE: Serialize sysfs changes
    
    The check_interval file in
    
      /sys/devices/system/machinecheck/machinecheck<cpu number>
    
    directory is a global timer value for MCE polling. If it is changed by one
    CPU, mce_restart() broadcasts the event to other CPUs to delete and restart
    the MCE polling timer and __mcheck_cpu_init_timer() reinitializes the
    mce_timer variable.
    
    If more than one CPU writes a specific value to the check_interval file
    concurrently, mce_timer is not protected from such concurrent accesses and
    all kinds of explosions happen. Since only root can write to those sysfs
    variables, the issue is not a big deal security-wise.
    
    However, concurrent writes to these configuration variables is void of
    reason so the proper thing to do is to serialize the access with a mutex.
    
    Boris:
    
     - Make store_int_with_restart() use device_store_ulong() to filter out
       negative intervals
     - Limit min interval to 1 second
     - Correct locking
     - Massage commit message
