    xen-blkback: don't leak stack data via response ring
    
    Rather than constructing a local structure instance on the stack, fill
    the fields directly on the shared ring, just like other backends do.
    Build on the fact that all response structure flavors are actually
    identical (the old code did make this assumption too).
    
    This is XSA-216.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit df80cd9b28b9ebaa284a41df611dbf3a2d05ca74
Author: Xin Long <lucien.xin@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Oct 17 23:26:10 2017 +0800

    sctp: do not peel off an assoc from one netns to another one
    
    Now when peeling off an association to the sock in another netns, all
    transports in this assoc are not to be rehashed and keep use the old
    key in hashtable.
    
    As a transport uses sk->net as the hash key to insert into hashtable,
    it would miss removing these transports from hashtable due to the new
    netns when closing the sock and all transports are being freeed, then
    later an use-after-free issue could be caused when looking up an asoc
    and dereferencing those transports.
    
    This is a very old issue since very beginning, ChunYu found it with
    syzkaller fuzz testing with this series:
    
      socket$inet6_sctp()
      bind$inet6()
      sendto$inet6()
      unshare(0x40000000)
      getsockopt$inet_sctp6_SCTP_GET_ASSOC_ID_LIST()
      getsockopt$inet_sctp6_SCTP_SOCKOPT_PEELOFF()
    
    This patch is to block this call when peeling one assoc off from one
    netns to another one, so that the netns of all transport would not
    go out-sync with the key in hashtable.
    
    Note that this patch didn't fix it by rehashing transports, as it's
    difficult to handle the situation when the tuple is already in use
    in the new netns. Besides, no one would like to peel off one assoc
    to another netns, considering ipaddrs, ifaces, etc. are usually
    different.

    ext4: fix data exposure after a crash
    
    Huang has reported that in his powerfail testing he is seeing stale
    block contents in some of recently allocated blocks although he mounts
    ext4 in data=ordered mode. After some investigation I have found out
    that indeed when delayed allocation is used, we don't add inode to
    transaction's list of inodes needing flushing before commit. Originally
    we were doing that but commit f3b59291a69d removed the logic with a
    flawed argument that it is not needed.
    
    The problem is that although for delayed allocated blocks we write their
    contents immediately after allocating them, there is no guarantee that
    the IO scheduler or device doesn't reorder things and thus transaction
    allocating blocks and attaching them to inode can reach stable storage
    before actual block contents. Actually whenever we attach freshly
    allocated blocks to inode using a written extent, we should add inode to
    transaction's ordered inode list to make sure we properly wait for block
    contents to be written before committing the transaction. So that is
    what we do in this patch. This also handles other cases where stale data
    exposure was possible - like filling hole via mmap in
    data=ordered,nodelalloc mode.
    
    The only exception to the above rule are extending direct IO writes where
    blkdev_direct_IO() waits for IO to complete before increasing i_size and
    thus stale data exposure is not possible. For now we don't complicate
    the code with optimizing this special case since the overhead is pretty
    low. In case this is observed to be a performance problem we can always
    handle it using a special flag to ext4_map_blocks().

    KVM: x86: fix singlestepping over syscall
    
    TF is handled a bit differently for syscall and sysret, compared
    to the other instructions: TF is checked after the instruction completes,
    so that the OS can disable #DB at a syscall by adding TF to FMASK.
    When the sysret is executed the #DB is taken "as if" the syscall insn
    just completed.
    
    KVM emulates syscall so that it can trap 32-bit syscall on Intel processors.
    Fix the behavior, otherwise you could get #DB on a user stack which is not
    nice.  This does not affect Linux guests, as they use an IST or task gate
    for #DB.
    
    This fixes CVE-2017-7518.

    bpf: don't let ldimm64 leak map addresses on unprivileged
    
    The patch fixes two things at once:
    
    1) It checks the env->allow_ptr_leaks and only prints the map address to
       the log if we have the privileges to do so, otherwise it just dumps 0
       as we would when kptr_restrict is enabled on %pK. Given the latter is
       off by default and not every distro sets it, I don't want to rely on
       this, hence the 0 by default for unprivileged.
    
    2) Printing of ldimm64 in the verifier log is currently broken in that
       we don't print the full immediate, but only the 32 bit part of the
       first insn part for ldimm64. Thus, fix this up as well; it's okay to
       access, since we verified all ldimm64 earlier already (including just
       constants) through replace_map_fd_with_map_ptr().
