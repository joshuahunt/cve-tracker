Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 712f4aad406bb1ed67f3f98d04c044191f0ff593
Author: willy tarreau <w@1wt.eu>
Date:   Sun Jan 10 07:54:56 2016 +0100

    unix: properly account for FDs passed over unix sockets
    
    It is possible for a process to allocate and accumulate far more FDs than
    the process' limit by sending them over a unix socket then closing them
    to keep the process' fd count low.
    
    This change addresses this problem by keeping track of the number of FDs
    in flight per user and preventing non-privileged processes from having
    more FDs in flight than their configured FD limit.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 7d267278a9ece963d77eefec61630223fce08c6c
Author: Rainer Weikusat <rweikusat@mobileactivedefense.com>
Date:   Fri Nov 20 22:07:23 2015 +0000

    unix: avoid use-after-free in ep_remove_wait_queue
    
    Rainer Weikusat <rweikusat@mobileactivedefense.com> writes:
    An AF_UNIX datagram socket being the client in an n:1 association with
    some server socket is only allowed to send messages to the server if the
    receive queue of this socket contains at most sk_max_ack_backlog
    datagrams. This implies that prospective writers might be forced to go
    to sleep despite none of the message presently enqueued on the server
    receive queue were sent by them. In order to ensure that these will be
    woken up once space becomes again available, the present unix_dgram_poll
    routine does a second sock_poll_wait call with the peer_wait wait queue
    of the server socket as queue argument (unix_dgram_recvmsg does a wake
    up on this queue after a datagram was received). This is inherently
    problematic because the server socket is only guaranteed to remain alive
    for as long as the client still holds a reference to it. In case the
    connection is dissolved via connect or by the dead peer detection logic
    in unix_dgram_sendmsg, the server socket may be freed despite "the
    polling mechanism" (in particular, epoll) still has a pointer to the
    corresponding peer_wait queue. There's no way to forcibly deregister a
    wait queue with epoll.
    
    Based on an idea by Jason Baron, the patch below changes the code such
    that a wait_queue_t belonging to the client socket is enqueued on the
    peer_wait queue of the server whenever the peer receive queue full
    condition is detected by either a sendmsg or a poll. A wake up on the
    peer queue is then relayed to the ordinary wait queue of the client
    socket via wake function. The connection to the peer wait queue is again
    dissolved if either a wake up is about to be relayed or the client
    socket reconnects or a dead peer is detected or the client socket is
    itself closed. This enables removing the second sock_poll_wait from
    unix_dgram_poll, thus avoiding the use-after-free, while still ensuring
    that no blocked writer sleeps forever.

    KEYS: ensure we free the assoc array edit if edit is valid
    
    __key_link_end is not freeing the associated array edit structure
    and this leads to a 512 byte memory leak each time an identical
    existing key is added with add_key().
    
    The reason the add_key() system call returns okay is that
    key_create_or_update() calls __key_link_begin() before checking to see
    whether it can update a key directly rather than adding/replacing - which
    it turns out it can.  Thus __key_link() is not called through
    __key_instantiate_and_link() and __key_link_end() must cancel the edit.

    vfs: Test for and handle paths that are unreachable from their mnt_root
    
    In rare cases a directory can be renamed out from under a bind mount.
    In those cases without special handling it becomes possible to walk up
    the directory tree to the root dentry of the filesystem and down
    from the root dentry to every other file or directory on the filesystem.
    
    Like division by zero .. from an unconnected path can not be given
    a useful semantic as there is no predicting at which path component
    the code will realize it is unconnected.  We certainly can not match
    the current behavior as the current behavior is a security hole.
    
    Therefore when encounting .. when following an unconnected path
    return -ENOENT.
    
    - Add a function path_connected to verify path->dentry is reachable
      from path->mnt.mnt_root.  AKA to validate that rename did not do
      something nasty to the bind mount.
    
      To avoid races path_connected must be called after following a path
      component to it's next path component.

commit cde93be45a8a90d8c264c776fab63487b5038a65

    dcache: Handle escaped paths in prepend_path
    
    A rename can result in a dentry that by walking up d_parent
    will never reach it's mnt_root.  For lack of a better term
    I call this an escaped path.
    
    prepend_path is called by four different functions __d_path,
    d_absolute_path, d_path, and getcwd.
    
    __d_path only wants to see paths are connected to the root it passes
    in.  So __d_path needs prepend_path to return an error.
    
    d_absolute_path similarly wants to see paths that are connected to
    some root.  Escaped paths are not connected to any mnt_root so
    d_absolute_path needs prepend_path to return an error greater
    than 1.  So escaped paths will be treated like paths on lazily
    unmounted mounts.
    
    getcwd needs to prepend "(unreachable)" so getcwd also needs
    prepend_path to return an error.
    
    d_path is the interesting hold out.  d_path just wants to print
    something, and does not care about the weird cases.  Which raises
    the question what should be printed?
    
    Given that <escaped_path>/<anything> should result in -ENOENT I
    believe it is desirable for escaped paths to be printed as empty
    paths.  As there are not really any meaninful path components when
    considered from the perspective of a mount tree.
    
    So tweak prepend_path to return an empty path with an new error
    code of 3 when it encounters an escaped path.

    sctp_setsockopt_auto_asconf() which doesn't guarantee any serialization.
    
    Also, the call to inet_sk_copy_descendant() was backuping
    ->auto_asconf_list through the copy but was not honoring
    ->do_auto_asconf, which could lead to list corruption if it was
    different between both sockets.
    
    This commit thus fixes the list handling by using ->addr_wq_lock
    spinlock to protect the list. A special handling is done upon socket
    creation and destruction for that. Error handlig on sctp_init_sock()
    will never return an error after having initialized asconf, so
    sctp_destroy_sock() can be called without addrq_wq_lock. The lock now
    will be take on sctp_close_sock(), before locking the socket, so we
    don't do it in inverse order compared to sctp_addr_wq_timeout_handler().
    
    Instead of taking the lock on sctp_sock_migrate() for copying and
    restoring the list values, it's preferred to avoid rewritting it by
    implementing sctp_copy_descendant().
    
    Issue was found with a test application that kept flipping sysctl
    default_auto_asconf on and off, but one could trigger it by issuing
    simultaneous setsockopt() calls on multiple sockets or by
    creating/destroying sockets fast enough. This is only triggerable
    locally.

    mm: avoid setting up anonymous pages into file mapping
    
    Reading page fault handler code I've noticed that under right
    circumstances kernel would map anonymous pages into file mappings: if
    the VMA doesn't have vm_ops->fault() and the VMA wasn't fully populated
    on ->mmap(), kernel would handle page fault to not populated pte with
    do_anonymous_page().
    
    Let's change page fault handler to use do_anonymous_page() only on
    anonymous VMA (->vm_ops == NULL) and make sure that the VMA is not
    shared.
    
    For file mappings without vm_ops->fault() or shred VMA without vm_ops,
    page fault on pte_none() entry would lead to SIGBUS.

    x86/nmi/64: Use DF to avoid userspace RSP confusing nested NMI detection
    
    We have a tricky bug in the nested NMI code: if we see RSP
    pointing to the NMI stack on NMI entry from kernel mode, we
    assume that we are executing a nested NMI.
    
    This isn't quite true.  A malicious userspace program can point
    RSP at the NMI stack, issue SYSCALL, and arrange for an NMI to
    happen while RSP is still pointing at the NMI stack.
    
    Fix it with a sneaky trick.  Set DF in the region of code that
    the RSP check is intended to detect.  IRET will clear DF
    atomically.
    
    ( Note: other than paravirt, there's little need for all this
      complexity. We could check RIP instead of RSP. )

    The problem is that after those calls to sctp_v{4,6}_protosw_init(), it
    is possible for userspace to create SCTP sockets like if the module is
    already fully loaded. If that happens, one of the possible effects is
    that we will have readers for net->sctp.local_addr_list list earlier
    than expected and sctp_net_init() does not take precautions while
    dealing with that list, leading to a potential panic but not limited to
    that, as sctp_sock_init() will copy a bunch of blank/partially
    initialized values from net->sctp.
    
    The race happens like this:
    
         CPU 0                           |  CPU 1
      socket()                           |
       __sock_create                     | socket()
        inet_create                      |  __sock_create
         list_for_each_entry_rcu(        |
            answer, &inetsw[sock->type], |
            list) {                      |   inet_create
          /* no hits */                  |
         if (unlikely(err)) {            |
          ...                            |
          request_module()               |
          /* socket creation is blocked  |
           * the module is fully loaded  |
           */                            |
           sctp_init                     |
            sctp_v4_protosw_init         |
             inet_register_protosw       |
              list_add_rcu(&p->list,     |
                           last_perm);   |
                                         |  list_for_each_entry_rcu(
                                         |     answer, &inetsw[sock->type],
            sctp_v6_protosw_init         |     list) {
                                         |     /* hit, so assumes protocol
                                         |      * is already loaded
                                         |      */
                                         |  /* socket creation continues
                                         |   * before netns is initialized
                                         |   */
            register_pernet_subsys       |
    
    Simply inverting the initialization order between
    register_pernet_subsys() and sctp_v4_protosw_init() is not possible
    because register_pernet_subsys() will create a control sctp socket, so
    the protocol must be already visible by then. Deferring the socket
    creation to a work-queue is not good specially because we loose the
    ability to handle its errors.
    
    So, as suggested by Vlad, the fix is to split netns initialization in
    two moments: defaults and control socket, so that the defaults are
    already loaded by when we register the protocol, while control socket
    initialization is kept at the same moment it is today.

    KVM: x86: work around infinite loop in microcode when #AC is delivered
    
    It was found that a guest can DoS a host by triggering an infinite
    stream of "alignment check" (#AC) exceptions.  This causes the
    microcode to enter an infinite loop where the core never receives
    another interrupt.  The host kernel panics pretty quickly due to the
    effects (CVE-2015-5307).

    X.509: Fix the time validation [ver #2]
    
    This fixes CVE-2015-5327.  It affects kernels from 4.3-rc1 onwards.
    
    Fix the X.509 time validation to use month number-1 when looking up the
    number of days in that month.  Also put the month number validation before
    doing the lookup so as not to risk overrunning the array.
    
    This can be tested by doing the following:
    
    cat <<EOF | openssl x509 -outform DER | keyctl padd asymmetric "" @s

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit b6878d9e03043695dbf3fa1caa6dfc09db225b16
Author: Benjamin Randazzo <benjamin@randazzo.fr>

    md: use kzalloc() when bitmap is disabled
    
    In drivers/md/md.c get_bitmap_file() uses kmalloc() for creating a
    mdu_bitmap_file_t called "file".
    
    5769         file = kmalloc(sizeof(*file), GFP_NOIO);
    5770         if (!file)
    5771                 return -ENOMEM;
    
    This structure is copied to user space at the end of the function.
    
    5786         if (err == 0 &&
    5787             copy_to_user(arg, file, sizeof(*file)))
    5788                 err = -EFAULT
    
    But if bitmap is disabled only the first byte of "file" is initialized
    with zero, so it's possible to read some bytes (up to 4095) of kernel
    space memory from user space. This is an information leak.
    
    5775         /* bitmap disabled, zero the first byte and copy out */
    5776         if (!mddev->bitmap_info.file)
    5777                 file->pathname[0] = '\0';

    RDS: verify the underlying transport exists before creating a connection
    
    There was no verification that an underlying transport exists when creating
    a connection, this would cause dereferencing a NULL ptr.
    
    It might happen on sockets that weren't properly bound before attempting to
    send a message, which will cause a NULL ptr deref:

    KVM: x86: Reload pit counters for all channels when restoring state
    
    Currently if userspace restores the pit counters with a count of 0
    on channels 1 or 2 and the guest attempts to read the count on those
    channels, then KVM will perform a mod of 0 and crash.  This will ensure
    that 0 values are converted to 65536 as per the spec.

    The aiptek driver crashes in aiptek_probe() when a specially crafted USB
    device without endpoints is detected. This fix adds a check that the device
    has proper configuration expected by the driver. Also an error return value
    is changed to more matching one in one of the error paths.

commit b4a1b4f5047e4f54e194681125c74c0aa64d637d
Author: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>

    KEYS: Fix race between read and revoke
    
    This fixes CVE-2015-7550.
    
    There's a race between keyctl_read() and keyctl_revoke().  If the revoke
    happens between keyctl_read() checking the validity of a key and the key's
    semaphore being taken, then the key type read method will see a revoked key.
    
    This causes a problem for the user-defined key type because it assumes in
    its read method that there will always be a payload in a non-revoked key
    and doesn't check for a NULL pointer.
    
    Fix this by making keyctl_read() check the validity of a key after taking
    semaphore instead of before.
    
    I think the bug was introduced with the original keyrings code.
    
    This was discovered by a multithreaded test program generated by syzkaller
    (http://github.com/google/syzkaller).  Here's a cleaned up version:
    
    	#include <sys/types.h>
    	#include <keyutils.h>
    	#include <pthread.h>
    	void *thr0(void *arg)
    	{
    		key_serial_t key = (unsigned long)arg;
    		keyctl_revoke(key);
    		return 0;
    	}
    	void *thr1(void *arg)
    	{
    		key_serial_t key = (unsigned long)arg;
    		char buffer[16];
    		keyctl_read(key, buffer, 16);
    		return 0;
    	}
    	int main()
    	{
    		key_serial_t key = add_key("user", "%", "foo", 3, KEY_SPEC_USER_KEYRING);
    		pthread_t th[5];
    		pthread_create(&th[0], 0, thr0, (void *)(unsigned long)key);
    		pthread_create(&th[1], 0, thr1, (void *)(unsigned long)key);
    		pthread_create(&th[2], 0, thr0, (void *)(unsigned long)key);
    		pthread_create(&th[3], 0, thr1, (void *)(unsigned long)key);
    		pthread_join(th[0], 0);
    		pthread_join(th[1], 0);
    		pthread_join(th[2], 0);
    		pthread_join(th[3], 0);
    		return 0;
    	}
    
    Build as:
    
    	cc -o keyctl-race keyctl-race.c -lkeyutils -lpthread
    
    Run as:
    
    	while keyctl-race; do :; done
    
    as it may need several iterations to crash the kernel.  The crash can be
    summarised as:
    
    	BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000010
    	IP: [<ffffffff81279b08>] user_read+0x56/0xa3

    Initialize msg/shm IPC objects before doing ipc_addid()
    
    As reported by Dmitry Vyukov, we really shouldn't do ipc_addid() before
    having initialized the IPC object state.  Yes, we initialize the IPC
    object in a locked state, but with all the lockless RCU lookup work,
    that IPC object lock no longer means that the state cannot be seen.
    
    We already did this for the IPC semaphore code (see commit e8577d1f0329:
    "ipc/sem.c: fully initialize sem_array before making it visible") but we
    clearly forgot about msg and shm.

    [media] usbvision: revert commit 588afcc1
    
    Commit 588afcc1c0e4 ("[media] usbvision fix overflow of interfaces
    array")' should be reverted, because:
    
    * "!dev->actconfig->interface[ifnum]" won't catch a case where the value
    is not NULL but some garbage. This way the system may crash later with
    GPF.
    
    * "(ifnum >= USB_MAXINTERFACES)" does not cover all the error
    conditions. "ifnum" should be compared to "dev->actconfig->
    desc.bNumInterfaces", i.e. compared to the number of "struct
    usb_interface" kzalloc()-ed, not to USB_MAXINTERFACES.
    
    * There is a "struct usb_device" leak in this error path, as there is
    usb_get_dev(), but no usb_put_dev() on this path.
    
    * There is a bug of the same type several lines below with number of
    endpoints. The code is accessing hard-coded second endpoint
    ("interface->endpoint[1].desc") which may not exist. It would be great
    to handle this in the same patch too.
    
    * All the concerns above are resolved by already-accepted commit fa52bd50
    ("[media] usbvision: fix crash on detecting device with invalid
    configuration")

commit f05819df10d7b09f6d1eb6f8534a8f68e5a4fe61
Author: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>
Date:   Thu Oct 15 17:21:37 2015 +0100

    KEYS: Fix crash when attempt to garbage collect an uninstantiated keyring
    
    The following sequence of commands:
    
        i=`keyctl add user a a @s`
        keyctl request2 keyring foo bar @t
        keyctl unlink $i @s
    
    tries to invoke an upcall to instantiate a keyring if one doesn't already
    exist by that name within the user's keyring set.  However, if the upcall
    fails, the code sets keyring->type_data.reject_error to -ENOKEY or some
    other error code.  When the key is garbage collected, the key destroy

    RDS: fix race condition when sending a message on unbound socket
    
    Sasha's found a NULL pointer dereference in the RDS connection code when
    sending a message to an apparently unbound socket.  The problem is caused
    by the code checking if the socket is bound in rds_sendmsg(), which checks
    the rs_bound_addr field without taking a lock on the socket.  This opens a
    race where rs_bound_addr is temporarily set but where the transport is not
    in rds_bind(), leading to a NULL pointer dereference when trying to
    dereference 'trans' in __rds_conn_create().
    
    Vegard wrote a reproducer for this issue, so kindly ask him to share if
    you're interested.
    
    I cannot reproduce the NULL pointer dereference using Vegard's reproducer
    with this patch, whereas I could without.

    Btrfs: fix truncation of compressed and inlined extents
    
    When truncating a file to a smaller size which consists of an inline
    extent that is compressed, we did not discard (or made unusable) the
    data between the new file size and the old file size, wasting metadata
    space and allowing for the truncated data to be leaked and the data
    corruption/loss mentioned below.
    We were also not correctly decrementing the number of bytes used by the
    inode, we were setting it to zero, giving a wrong report for callers of
    the stat(2) syscall. The fsck tool also reported an error about a mismatch
    between the nbytes of the file versus the real space used by the file.
    
    Now because we weren't discarding the truncated region of the file, it
    was possible for a caller of the clone ioctl to actually read the data
    that was truncated, allowing for a security breach without requiring root
    access to the system, using only standard filesystem operations. The
    scenario is the following:
    
       1) User A creates a file which consists of an inline and compressed
          extent with a size of 2000 bytes - the file is not accessible to
          any other users (no read, write or execution permission for anyone
          else);
    
       2) The user truncates the file to a size of 1000 bytes;
    
       3) User A makes the file world readable;
    
       4) User B creates a file consisting of an inline extent of 2000 bytes;
    
       5) User B issues a clone operation from user A's file into its own
          file (using a length argument of 0, clone the whole range);
    
       6) User B now gets to see the 1000 bytes that user A truncated from
          its file before it made its file world readbale. User B also lost
          the bytes in the range [1000, 2000[ bytes from its own file, but
          that might be ok if his/her intention was reading stale data from
          user A that was never supposed to be public.
    
    Note that this contrasts with the case where we truncate a file from 2000
    bytes to 1000 bytes and then truncate it back from 1000 to 2000 bytes. In
    this case reading any byte from the range [1000, 2000[ will return a value
    of 0x00, instead of the original data.
    
    This problem exists since the clone ioctl was added and happens both with
    and without my recent data loss and file corruption fixes for the clone
    ioctl (patch "Btrfs: fix file corruption and data loss after cloning
    inline extents").
    
    So fix this by truncating the compressed inline extents as we do for the
    non-compressed case, which involves decompressing, if the data isn't already
    in the page cache, compressing the truncated version of the extent, writing
    the compressed content into the inline extent and then truncate it.
    
    The following test case for fstests reproduces the problem. In order for
    the test to pass both this fix and my previous fix for the clone ioctl
    that forbids cloning a smaller inline extent into a larger one,
    which is titled "Btrfs: fix file corruption and data loss after cloning
    inline extents", are needed. Without that other fix the test fails in a
    different way that does not leak the truncated data, instead part of
    destination file gets replaced with zeroes (because the destination file
    has a larger inline extent than the source).

      # Now durably persist all metadata and data. We do this to make sure that we get
      # on disk an inline extent with a size of 512 bytes for file foo.
      sync
    
      # Now truncate our file foo to a smaller size. Because it consists of a
      # compressed and inline extent, btrfs did not shrink the inline extent to the
      # new size (if the extent was not compressed, btrfs would shrink it to 128
      # bytes), it only updates the inode's i_size to 128 bytes.
      $XFS_IO_PROG -c "truncate 128" $SCRATCH_MNT/foo
    
      # Now clone foo's inline extent into bar.
      # This clone operation should fail with errno EOPNOTSUPP because the source
      # file consists only of an inline extent and the file's size is smaller than
      # the inline extent of the destination (128 bytes < 256 bytes). However the
      # clone ioctl was not prepared to deal with a file that has a size smaller
      # than the size of its inline extent (something that happens only for compressed
      # inline extents), resulting in copying the full inline extent from the source
      # file into the destination file.
      #
      # Note that btrfs' clone operation for inline extents consists of removing the
      # inline extent from the destination inode and copy the inline extent from the
      # source inode into the destination inode, meaning that if the destination
      # inode's inline extent is larger (N bytes) than the source inode's inline
      # extent (M bytes), some bytes (N - M bytes) will be lost from the destination
      # file. Btrfs could copy the source inline extent's data into the destination's
      # inline extent so that we would not lose any data, but that's currently not
      # done due to the complexity that would be needed to deal with such cases
      # (specially when one or both extents are compressed), returning EOPNOTSUPP, as
      # it's normally not a very common case to clone very small files (only case
      # where we get inline extents) and copying inline extents does not save any
      # space (unlike for normal, non-inlined extents).
      $CLONER_PROG -s 0 -d 0 -l 0 $SCRATCH_MNT/foo $SCRATCH_MNT/bar
    
      # Now because the above clone operation used to succeed, and due to foo's inline
      # extent not being shinked by the truncate operation, our file bar got the whole
      # inline extent copied from foo, making us lose the last 128 bytes from bar
      # which got replaced by the bytes in range [128, 256[ from foo before foo was
      # truncated - in other words, data loss from bar and being able to read old and
      # stale data from foo that should not be possible to read anymore through normal
      # filesystem operations. Contrast with the case where we truncate a file from a
      # size N to a smaller size M, truncate it back to size N and then read the range
      # [M, N[, we should always get the value 0x00 for all the bytes in that range.
    
      # We expected the clone operation to fail with errno EOPNOTSUPP and therefore
      # not modify our file's bar data/metadata. So its content should be 256 bytes
      # long with all bytes having the value 0xbb.
      #
      # Without the btrfs bug fix, the clone operation succeeded and resulted in
      # leaking truncated data from foo, the bytes that belonged to its range
      # [128, 256[, and losing data from bar in that same range. So reading the
      # file gave us the following content:
      #
      # 0000000 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1
      # *
      # 0000200 2a 2a 2a 2a 2a 2a 2a 2a 2a 2a 2a 2a 2a 2a 2a 2a

      # 0000400
      echo "File bar's content after the clone operation:"
      od -t x1 $SCRATCH_MNT/bar
    
      # Also because the foo's inline extent was not shrunk by the truncate
      # operation, btrfs' fsck, which is run by the fstests framework everytime a

    KEYS: Fix handling of stored error in a negatively instantiated user key
    
    If a user key gets negatively instantiated, an error code is cached in the
    payload area.  A negatively instantiated key may be then be positively
    instantiated by updating it with valid data.  However, the ->update key
    type method must be aware that the error code may be there.
    
    The following may be used to trigger the bug in the user key type:
    
        keyctl request2 user user "" @u
        keyctl add user user "a" @u
    
    which manifests itself as:

    net: add validation for the socket syscall protocol argument
    
    郭永刚 reported that one could simply crash the kernel as root by
    using a simple program:
    
    	int socket_fd;
    	struct sockaddr_in addr;
    	addr.sin_port = 0;
    	addr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
    	addr.sin_family = 10;
    
    	socket_fd = socket(10,3,0x40000000);
    	connect(socket_fd , &addr,16);
    
    AF_INET, AF_INET6 sockets actually only support 8-bit protocol
    identifiers. inet_sock's skc_protocol field thus is sized accordingly,
    thus larger protocol identifiers simply cut off the higher bits and
    store a zero in the protocol fields.
    
    This could lead to e.g. NULL function pointer because as a result of
    the cut off inet_num is zero and we call down to inet_autobind, which
    is NULL for raw sockets.
    
    kernel: Call Trace:
    kernel:  [<ffffffff816db90e>] ? inet_autobind+0x2e/0x70

    The last from guest transmitted request gives no indication about the
    minimum amount of credit that the guest might need to send a packet
    since the last packet might have been a small one.
    
    Instead allow for the worst case 128 KiB packet.

    xen: Add RING_COPY_REQUEST()
    
    Using RING_GET_REQUEST() on a shared ring is easy to use incorrectly
    (i.e., by not considering that the other end may alter the data in the
    shared ring while it is being inspected).  Safe usage of a request
    generally requires taking a local copy.
    
    Provide a RING_COPY_REQUEST() macro to use instead of
    RING_GET_REQUEST() and an open-coded memcpy().  This takes care of
    ensuring that the copy is done correctly regardless of any possible
    compiler optimizations.
    
    Use a volatile source to prevent the compiler from reordering or
    omitting the copy.

    xen-netback: use RING_COPY_REQUEST() throughout
    
    Instead of open-coding memcpy()s and directly accessing Tx and Rx
    requests, use the new RING_COPY_REQUEST() that ensures the local copy
    is correct.
    
    This is more than is strictly necessary for guest Rx requests since
    only the id and gref fields are used and it is harmless if the
    frontend modifies these.

    xen/pciback: Save xen_pci_op commands before processing it
    
    Double fetch vulnerabilities that happen when a variable is
    fetched twice from shared memory but a security check is only
    performed the first time.
    
    The xen_pcibk_do_op function performs a switch statements on the op->cmd
    value which is stored in shared memory. Interestingly this can result
    in a double fetch vulnerability depending on the performed compiler
    optimization.
    
    This patch fixes it by saving the xen_pci_op command before
    processing it. We also use 'barrier' to make sure that the
    compiler does not perform any optimization.
    
    This is part of XSA155.

    xen-blkback: read from indirect descriptors only once
    
    Since indirect descriptors are in memory shared with the frontend, the
    frontend could alter the first_sect and last_sect values after they have
    been validated but before they are recorded in the request.  This may
    result in I/O requests that overflow the foreign page, possibly
    overwriting local pages when the I/O request is executed.
    
    When parsing indirect descriptors, only read first_sect and last_sect

    teaches us that dealing with MSI-X can be troublesome.
    
    Further checks in the MSI-X architecture shows that if the
    PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY bit is turned of in the PCI_COMMAND we
    may not be able to access the BAR (since they are memory regions).
    
    Since the MSI-X tables are located in there.. that can lead
    to us causing PCIe errors. Inhibit us performing any
    operation on the MSI-X unless the MEMORY bit is set.
    
    Note that Xen hypervisor with:
    "x86/MSI-X: access MSI-X table only after having enabled MSI-X"
    will return:
    xen_pciback: 0000:0a:00.1: error -6 enabling MSI-X for guest 3!
    
    When the generic MSI code tries to setup the PIRQ without
    MEMORY bit set. Which means with later versions of Xen
    (4.6) this patch is not neccessary.
    
    This is part of XSA-157

    xen/pciback: Return error on XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msi when device has MSI or MSI-X enabled
    
    The guest sequence of:
    
     a) XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msi
     b) XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msi
     c) XEN_PCI_OP_disable_msi
    
    results in hitting an BUG_ON condition in the msi.c code.
    
    The MSI code uses an dev->msi_list to which it adds MSI entries.
    Under the above conditions an BUG_ON() can be hit. The device
    passed in the guest MUST have MSI capability.
    
    The a) adds the entry to the dev->msi_list and sets msi_enabled.
    The b) adds a second entry but adding in to SysFS fails (duplicate entry)
    and deletes all of the entries from msi_list and returns (with msi_enabled
    is still set).  c) pci_disable_msi passes the msi_enabled checks and hits:
    
    BUG_ON(list_empty(dev_to_msi_list(&dev->dev)));
    
    and blows up.
    
    The patch adds a simple check in the XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msi to guard
    against that. The check for msix_enabled is not stricly neccessary.

    xen/pciback: Return error on XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msix when device has MSI or MSI-X enabled
    
    The guest sequence of:
    
      a) XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msix
      b) XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msix
    
    results in hitting an NULL pointer due to using freed pointers.
    
    The device passed in the guest MUST have MSI-X capability.
    
    The a) constructs and SysFS representation of MSI and MSI groups.
    The b) adds a second set of them but adding in to SysFS fails (duplicate entry).
    'populate_msi_sysfs' frees the newly allocated msi_irq_groups (note that
    in a) pdev->msi_irq_groups is still set) and also free's ALL of the
    MSI-X entries of the device (the ones allocated in step a) and b)).
    
    The unwind code: 'free_msi_irqs' deletes all the entries and tries to
    delete the pdev->msi_irq_groups (which hasn't been set to NULL).
    However the pointers in the SysFS are already freed and we hit an
    NULL pointer further on when 'strlen' is attempted on a freed pointer.
    
    The patch adds a simple check in the XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msix to guard
    against that. The check for msi_enabled is not stricly neccessary.

    Otherwise just continue on, returning the same values as
    previously (return of 0, and op->result has the PIRQ value).
    
    This does not change the behavior of XEN_PCI_OP_disable_msi[|x].
    
    The pci_disable_msi or pci_disable_msix have the checks for
    msi_enabled or msix_enabled so they will error out immediately.
    
    However the guest can still call these operations and cause
    us to disable the 'ack_intr'. That means the backend IRQ handler
    for the legacy interrupt will not respond to interrupts anymore.
    
    This will lead to (if the device is causing an interrupt storm)
    for the Linux generic code to disable the interrupt line.
    
    Naturally this will only happen if the device in question
    is plugged in on the motherboard on shared level interrupt GSI.

commit a396f3a210c3a61e94d6b87ec05a75d0be2a60d0
Author: Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk <konrad.wilk@oracle.com>
Date:   Mon Nov 2 17:24:08 2015 -0500

    xen/pciback: Do not install an IRQ handler for MSI interrupts.
    
    Otherwise an guest can subvert the generic MSI code to trigger
    an BUG_ON condition during MSI interrupt freeing:
    
     for (i = 0; i < entry->nvec_used; i++)
            BUG_ON(irq_has_action(entry->irq + i));
    
    Xen PCI backed installs an IRQ handler (request_irq) for
    the dev->irq whenever the guest writes PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY
    (or PCI_COMMAND_IO) to the PCI_COMMAND register. This is
    done in case the device has legacy interrupts the GSI line
    is shared by the backend devices.
    
    To subvert the backend the guest needs to make the backend
    to change the dev->irq from the GSI to the MSI interrupt line,
    make the backend allocate an interrupt handler, and then command
    the backend to free the MSI interrupt and hit the BUG_ON.
    
    Since the backend only calls 'request_irq' when the guest
    writes to the PCI_COMMAND register the guest needs to call
    XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msi before any other operation. This will
    cause the generic MSI code to setup an MSI entry and
    populate dev->irq with the new PIRQ value.
    
    Then the guest can write to PCI_COMMAND PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY
    and cause the backend to setup an IRQ handler for dev->irq
    (which instead of the GSI value has the MSI pirq). See
    'xen_pcibk_control_isr'.
    
    Then the guest disables the MSI: XEN_PCI_OP_disable_msi
    which ends up triggering the BUG_ON condition in 'free_msi_irqs'
    as there is an IRQ handler for the entry->irq (dev->irq).
    
    Note that this cannot be done using MSI-X as the generic
    code does not over-write dev->irq with the MSI-X PIRQ values.
    
    The patch inhibits setting up the IRQ handler if MSI or
    MSI-X (for symmetry reasons) code had been called successfully.
    
    P.S.
    Xen PCIBack when it sets up the device for the guest consumption
    ends up writting 0 to the PCI_COMMAND (see xen_pcibk_reset_device).
    XSA-120 addendum patch removed that - however when upstreaming said
    addendum we found that it caused issues with qemu upstream. That
    has now been fixed in qemu upstream.
    
    This is part of XSA-157

    xen/pciback: Don't allow MSI-X ops if PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY is not set.
    
    commit f598282f51 ("PCI: Fix the NIU MSI-X problem in a better way")
    teaches us that dealing with MSI-X can be troublesome.
    
    Further checks in the MSI-X architecture shows that if the

    Since the MSI-X tables are located in there.. that can lead

    Note that Xen hypervisor with:

    will return:
    xen_pciback: 0000:0a:00.1: error -6 enabling MSI-X for guest 3!
    
    When the generic MSI code tries to setup the PIRQ without
    MEMORY bit set. Which means with later versions of Xen
    (4.6) this patch is not neccessary.

    Xen PCI backed installs an IRQ handler (request_irq) for
    the dev->irq whenever the guest writes PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY
    (or PCI_COMMAND_IO) to the PCI_COMMAND register. This is
    done in case the device has legacy interrupts the GSI line
    is shared by the backend devices.
    
    To subvert the backend the guest needs to make the backend
    to change the dev->irq from the GSI to the MSI interrupt line,
    make the backend allocate an interrupt handler, and then command
    the backend to free the MSI interrupt and hit the BUG_ON.
    
    Since the backend only calls 'request_irq' when the guest
    writes to the PCI_COMMAND register the guest needs to call
    XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msi before any other operation. This will
    cause the generic MSI code to setup an MSI entry and
    populate dev->irq with the new PIRQ value.
    
    Then the guest can write to PCI_COMMAND PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY
    and cause the backend to setup an IRQ handler for dev->irq
    (which instead of the GSI value has the MSI pirq). See
    'xen_pcibk_control_isr'.
    
    Then the guest disables the MSI: XEN_PCI_OP_disable_msi
    which ends up triggering the BUG_ON condition in 'free_msi_irqs'
    as there is an IRQ handler for the entry->irq (dev->irq).
    
    Note that this cannot be done using MSI-X as the generic
    code does not over-write dev->irq with the MSI-X PIRQ values.
    
    The patch inhibits setting up the IRQ handler if MSI or
    MSI-X (for symmetry reasons) code had been called successfully.
    
    P.S.
    Xen PCIBack when it sets up the device for the guest consumption
    ends up writting 0 to the PCI_COMMAND (see xen_pcibk_reset_device).
    XSA-120 addendum patch removed that - however when upstreaming said
    addendum we found that it caused issues with qemu upstream. That
    has now been fixed in qemu upstream.
    
    This is part of XSA-157

    ovl: fix permission checking for setattr
    
    [Al Viro] The bug is in being too enthusiastic about optimizing ->setattr()
    away - instead of "copy verbatim with metadata" + "chmod/chown/utimes"
    (with the former being always safe and the latter failing in case of
    insufficient permissions) it tries to combine these two.  Note that copyup
    itself will have to do ->setattr() anyway; _that_ is where the elevated
    capabilities are right.  Having these two ->setattr() (one to set verbatim
    copy of metadata, another to do what overlayfs ->setattr() had been asked
    to do in the first place) combined is where it breaks.

    sctp: Prevent soft lockup when sctp_accept() is called during a timeout event
    
    A case can occur when sctp_accept() is called by the user during
    a heartbeat timeout event after the 4-way handshake.  Since
    sctp_assoc_migrate() changes both assoc->base.sk and assoc->ep, the
    bh_sock_lock in sctp_generate_heartbeat_event() will be taken with
    the listening socket but released with the new association socket.
    The result is a deadlock on any future attempts to take the listening
    socket lock.
    
    Note that this race can occur with other SCTP timeouts that take
    the bh_lock_sock() in the event sctp_accept() is called.

    Ensure the socket taken is also the same one that is released by
    saving a copy of the socket before entering the timeout event
    critical section.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 3ca8138f014a913f98e6ef40e939868e1e9ea876
Author: Roman Gushchin <klamm@yandex-team.ru>
Date:   Mon Oct 12 16:33:44 2015 +0300

    fuse: break infinite loop in fuse_fill_write_pages()
    
    I got a report about unkillable task eating CPU. Further
    investigation shows, that the problem is in the fuse_fill_write_pages()
    function. If iov's first segment has zero length, we get an infinite
    loop, because we never reach iov_iter_advance() call.
    
    Fix this by calling iov_iter_advance() before repeating an attempt to
    copy data from userspace.
    
    A similar problem is described in 124d3b7041f ("fix writev regression:
    pan hanging unkillable and un-straceable"). If zero-length segmend
    is followed by segment with invalid address,
    iov_iter_fault_in_readable() checks only first segment (zero-length),
    iov_iter_copy_from_user_atomic() skips it, fails at second and
    returns zero -> goto again without skipping zero-length segment.
    
    Patch calls iov_iter_advance() before goto again: we'll skip zero-length
    segment at second iteraction and iov_iter_fault_in_readable() will detect
    invalid address.
    
    Special thanks to Konstantin Khlebnikov, who helped a lot with the commit
    description.

    In addition to the original one, we have seen the crash when packets that
    need to be redirected somehow arrive on an interface which hasn't been
    yet fully configured.
    
    This change just reverts the logic to the old behavior to avoid the crash.

    USB: fix invalid memory access in hub_activate()
    
    Commit 8520f38099cc ("USB: change hub initialization sleeps to
    delayed_work") changed the hub_activate() routine to make part of it
    run in a workqueue.  However, the commit failed to take a reference to
    the usb_hub structure or to lock the hub interface while doing so.  As
    a result, if a hub is plugged in and quickly unplugged before the work
    routine can run, the routine will try to access memory that has been
    deallocated.  Or, if the hub is unplugged while the routine is
    running, the memory may be deallocated while it is in active use.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by taking a reference to the usb_hub at
    the start of hub_activate() and releasing it at the end (when the work
    is finished), and by locking the hub interface while the work routine
    is running.  It also adds a check at the start of the routine to see
    if the hub has already been disconnected, in which nothing should be
    done.

    ext4: fix races of writeback with punch hole and zero range
    
    When doing delayed allocation, update of on-disk inode size is postponed
    until IO submission time. However hole punch or zero range fallocate
    calls can end up discarding the tail page cache page and thus on-disk
    inode size would never be properly updated.
    
    Make sure the on-disk inode size is updated before truncating page
    cache.

    ext4: move unlocked dio protection from ext4_alloc_file_blocks()
    
    Currently ext4_alloc_file_blocks() was handling protection against
    unlocked DIO. However we now need to sometimes call it under i_mmap_sem
    and sometimes not and DIO protection ranks above it (although strictly
    speaking this cannot currently create any deadlocks). Also
    ext4_zero_range() was actually getting & releasing unlocked DIO
    protection twice in some cases. Luckily it didn't introduce any real bug
    but it was a land mine waiting to be stepped on.  So move DIO protection
    out from ext4_alloc_file_blocks() into the two callsites.

    ext4: fix races between buffered IO and collapse / insert range
    
    Current code implementing FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE and
    FALLOC_FL_INSERT_RANGE is prone to races with buffered writes and page
    faults. If buffered write or write via mmap manages to squeeze between
    filemap_write_and_wait_range() and truncate_pagecache() in the fallocate
    implementations, the written data is simply discarded by
    truncate_pagecache() although it should have been shifted.
    
    Fix the problem by moving filemap_write_and_wait_range() call inside
    i_mutex and i_mmap_sem. That way we are protected against races with
    both buffered writes and page faults.

    ext4: fix races between page faults and hole punching
    
    Currently, page faults and hole punching are completely unsynchronized.
    This can result in page fault faulting in a page into a range that we
    are punching after truncate_pagecache_range() has been called and thus
    we can end up with a page mapped to disk blocks that will be shortly
    freed. Filesystem corruption will shortly follow. Note that the same
    race is avoided for truncate by checking page fault offset against
    i_size but there isn't similar mechanism available for punching holes.
    
    Fix the problem by creating new rw semaphore i_mmap_sem in inode and
    grab it for writing over truncate, hole punching, and other functions
    removing blocks from extent tree and for read over page faults. We
    cannot easily use i_data_sem for this since that ranks below transaction
    start and we need something ranking above it so that it can be held over
    the whole truncate / hole punching operation. Also remove various
    workarounds we had in the code to reduce race window when page fault
    could have created pages with stale mapping information.

    powerpc/tm: Block signal return setting invalid MSR state
    
    Currently we allow both the MSR T and S bits to be set by userspace on
    a signal return.  Unfortunately this is a reserved configuration and
    will cause a TM Bad Thing exception if attempted (via rfid).
    
    This patch checks for this case in both the 32 and 64 bit signals
    code.  If both T and S are set, we mark the context as invalid.
    
    Found using a syscall fuzzer.

    powerpc/tm: Check for already reclaimed tasks
    
    Currently we can hit a scenario where we'll tm_reclaim() twice.  This
    results in a TM bad thing exception because the second reclaim occurs
    when not in suspend mode.
    
    The scenario in which this can happen is the following.  We attempt to
    deliver a signal to userspace.  To do this we need obtain the stack
    pointer to write the signal context.  To get this stack pointer we
    must tm_reclaim() in case we need to use the checkpointed stack
    pointer (see get_tm_stackpointer()).  Normally we'd then return
    directly to userspace to deliver the signal without going through
    __switch_to().
    
    Unfortunatley, if at this point we get an error (such as a bad
    userspace stack pointer), we need to exit the process.  The exit will
    result in a __switch_to().  __switch_to() will attempt to save the
    process state which results in another tm_reclaim().  This
    tm_reclaim() now causes a TM Bad Thing exception as this state has
    already been saved and the processor is no longer in TM suspend mode.
    Whee!
    
    This patch checks the state of the MSR to ensure we are TM suspended
    before we attempt the tm_reclaim().  If we've already saved the state
    away, we should no longer be in TM suspend mode.  This has the
    additional advantage of checking for a potential TM Bad Thing
    exception.
    
    Found using syscall fuzzer.

    /proc/iomem: only expose physical resource addresses to privileged users
    
    In commit c4004b02f8e5b ("x86: remove the kernel code/data/bss resources
    from /proc/iomem") I was hoping to remove the phyiscal kernel address
    data from /proc/iomem entirely, but that had to be reverted because some
    system programs actually use it.
    
    This limits all the detailed resource information to properly
    credentialed users instead.

    ext2: convert to mbcache2
    
    The conversion is generally straightforward. We convert filesystem from
    a global cache to per-fs one. Similarly to ext4 the tricky part is that
    xattr block corresponding to found mbcache entry can get freed before we
    get buffer lock for that block. So we have to check whether the entry is
    still valid after getting the buffer lock.

    ovl: fix dentry reference leak
    
    In ovl_copy_up_locked(), newdentry is leaked if the function exits through
    out_cleanup as this just to out after calling ovl_cleanup() - which doesn't
    actually release the ref on newdentry.
    
    The out_cleanup segment should instead exit through out2 as certainly
    newdentry leaks - and possibly upper does also, though this isn't caught
    given the catch of newdentry.
    
    Without this fix, something like the following is seen:
    
    	BUG: Dentry ffff880023e9eb20{i=f861,n=#ffff880023e82d90} still in use (1) [unmount of tmpfs tmpfs]
    	BUG: Dentry ffff880023ece640{i=0,n=bigfile}  still in use (1) [unmount of tmpfs tmpfs]
    
    when unmounting the upper layer after an error occurred in copyup.
    
    An error can be induced by creating a big file in a lower layer with
    something like:
    
    	dd if=/dev/zero of=/lower/a/bigfile bs=65536 count=1 seek=$((0xf000))
    
    to create a large file (4.1G).  Overlay an upper layer that is too small
    (on tmpfs might do) and then induce a copy up by opening it writably.

    crypto: af_alg - Disallow bind/setkey/... after accept(2)
    
    Each af_alg parent socket obtained by socket(2) corresponds to a
    tfm object once bind(2) has succeeded.  An accept(2) call on that
    parent socket creates a context which then uses the tfm object.
    
    Therefore as long as any child sockets created by accept(2) exist
    the parent socket must not be modified or freed.
    
    This patch guarantees this by using locks and a reference count
    on the parent socket.  Any attempt to modify the parent socket will
    fail with EBUSY.

    Some cipher implementations will crash if you try to use them
    without calling setkey first.  This patch adds a check so that
    the accept(2) call will fail with -ENOKEY if setkey hasn't been
    done on the socket yet.

commit 9aacdd354d197ad64685941b36d28ea20ab88757

    fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c: fix bugs in hugetlb_vmtruncate_list()
    
    Hillf Danton noticed bugs in the hugetlb_vmtruncate_list routine.  The
    argument end is of type pgoff_t.  It was being converted to a vaddr
    offset and passed to unmap_hugepage_range.  However, end was also being
    used as an argument to the vma_interval_tree_foreach controlling loop.
    In addition, the conversion of end to vaddr offset was incorrect.
    
    hugetlb_vmtruncate_list is called as part of a file truncate or
    fallocate hole punch operation.
    
    When truncating a hugetlbfs file, this bug could prevent some pages from
    being unmapped.  This is possible if there are multiple vmas mapping the
    file, and there is a sufficiently sized hole between the mappings.  The
    size of the hole between two vmas (A,B) must be such that the starting
    virtual address of B is greater than (ending virtual address of A <<
    PAGE_SHIFT).  In this case, the pages in B would not be unmapped.  If
    pages are not properly unmapped during truncate, the following BUG is
    hit:
    
    	kernel BUG at fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c:428!
    
    In the fallocate hole punch case, this bug could prevent pages from
    being unmapped as in the truncate case.  However, for hole punch the
    result is that unmapped pages will not be removed during the operation.
    For hole punch, it is also possible that more pages than desired will be
    unmapped.  This unnecessary unmapping will cause page faults to
    reestablish the mappings on subsequent page access.

    tty: Fix unsafe ldisc reference via ioctl(TIOCGETD)
    
    ioctl(TIOCGETD) retrieves the line discipline id directly from the
    ldisc because the line discipline id (c_line) in termios is untrustworthy;
    userspace may have set termios via ioctl(TCSETS*) without actually
    changing the line discipline via ioctl(TIOCSETD).
    
    However, directly accessing the current ldisc via tty->ldisc is
    unsafe; the ldisc ptr dereferenced may be stale if the line discipline
    is changing via ioctl(TIOCSETD) or hangup.
    
    Wait for the line discipline reference (just like read() or write())
    to retrieve the "current" line discipline id.

    KEYS: Fix keyring ref leak in join_session_keyring()
    
    This fixes CVE-2016-0728.
    
    If a thread is asked to join as a session keyring the keyring that's already
    set as its session, we leak a keyring reference.
    
    This can be tested with the following program:
    
    	#include <stddef.h>
    	#include <stdio.h>
    	#include <sys/types.h>
    	#include <keyutils.h>
    
    	int main(int argc, const char *argv[])
    	{
    		int i = 0;
    		key_serial_t serial;
    
    		serial = keyctl(KEYCTL_JOIN_SESSION_KEYRING,
    				"leaked-keyring");
    		if (serial < 0) {
    			perror("keyctl");
    			return -1;
    		}
    
    		if (keyctl(KEYCTL_SETPERM, serial,
    			   KEY_POS_ALL | KEY_USR_ALL) < 0) {
    			perror("keyctl");
    			return -1;
    		}
    
    		for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    			serial = keyctl(KEYCTL_JOIN_SESSION_KEYRING,
    					"leaked-keyring");
    			if (serial < 0) {
    				perror("keyctl");
    				return -1;
    			}
    		}
    
    		return 0;
    	}
    
    If, after the program has run, there something like the following line in
    /proc/keys:
    
    3f3d898f I--Q---   100 perm 3f3f0000     0     0 keyring   leaked-keyring: empty
    
    with a usage count of 100 * the number of times the program has been run,
    then the kernel is malfunctioning.  If leaked-keyring has zero usages or
    has been garbage collected, then the problem is fixed.

    KEYS: Fix ASN.1 indefinite length object parsing
    
    This fixes CVE-2016-0758.
    
    In the ASN.1 decoder, when the length field of an ASN.1 value is extracted,
    it isn't validated against the remaining amount of data before being added
    to the cursor.  With a sufficiently large size indicated, the check:
    
    	datalen - dp < 2
    
    may then fail due to integer overflow.
    
    Fix this by checking the length indicated against the amount of remaining
    data in both places a definite length is determined.
    
    Whilst we're at it, make the following changes:
    
     (1) Check the maximum size of extended length does not exceed the capacity
         of the variable it's being stored in (len) rather than the type that
         variable is assumed to be (size_t).
    
     (2) Compare the EOC tag to the symbolic constant ASN1_EOC rather than the
         integer 0.
    
     (3) To reduce confusion, move the initialisation of len outside of:
    
    	for (len = 0; n > 0; n--) {
    
         since it doesn't have anything to do with the loop counter n.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 8a5e5e02fc83aaf67053ab53b359af08c6c49aaf
Author: Vasily Kulikov <segoon@openwall.com>
Date:   Wed Sep 9 15:36:00 2015 -0700

    include/linux/poison.h: fix LIST_POISON{1,2} offset
    
    Poison pointer values should be small enough to find a room in
    non-mmap'able/hardly-mmap'able space.  E.g.  on x86 "poison pointer space"
    is located starting from 0x0.  Given unprivileged users cannot mmap
    anything below mmap_min_addr, it should be safe to use poison pointers
    lower than mmap_min_addr.
    
    The current poison pointer values of LIST_POISON{1,2} might be too big for
    mmap_min_addr values equal or less than 1 MB (common case, e.g.  Ubuntu
    uses only 0x10000).  There is little point to use such a big value given
    the "poison pointer space" below 1 MB is not yet exhausted.  Changing it
    to a smaller value solves the problem for small mmap_min_addr setups.
    
    The values are suggested by Solar Designer:

Author: Ben Hutchings <ben@decadent.org.uk>
Date:   Wed Jun 22 19:43:35 2016 +0100

    nfsd: check permissions when setting ACLs
    
    Use set_posix_acl, which includes proper permission checks, instead of
    calling ->set_acl directly.  Without this anyone may be able to grant
    themselves permissions to a file by setting the ACL.
    
    Lock the inode to make the new checks atomic with respect to set_acl.
    (Also, nfsd was the only caller of set_acl not locking the inode, so I
    suspect this may fix other races.)
    
    This also simplifies the code, and ensures our ACLs are checked by
    posix_acl_valid.
    
    The permission checks and the inode locking were lost with commit
    4ac7249e, which changed nfsd to use the set_acl inode operation directly
    instead of going through xattr handlers.

    proc: prevent stacking filesystems on top
    
    This prevents stacking filesystems (ecryptfs and overlayfs) from using
    procfs as lower filesystem.  There is too much magic going on inside
    procfs, and there is no good reason to stack stuff on top of procfs.
    
    (For example, procfs does access checks in VFS open handlers, and
    ecryptfs by design calls open handlers from a kernel thread that doesn't
    drop privileges or so.)

    sched: panic on corrupted stack end
    
    Until now, hitting this BUG_ON caused a recursive oops (because oops
    handling involves do_exit(), which calls into the scheduler, which in
    turn raises an oops), which caused stuff below the stack to be
    overwritten until a panic happened (e.g.  via an oops in interrupt
    context, caused by the overwritten CPU index in the thread_info).
    
    Just panic directly.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 0d62e9dd6da45bbf0f33a8617afc5fe774c8f45f
Author: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>
Date:   Wed Aug 5 12:54:46 2015 +0100

    ASN.1: Fix non-match detection failure on data overrun
    
    If the ASN.1 decoder is asked to parse a sequence of objects, non-optional
    matches get skipped if there's no more data to be had rather than a
    data-overrun error being reported.
    
    This is due to the code segment that decides whether to skip optional
    matches (ie. matches that could get ignored because an element is marked
    OPTIONAL in the grammar) due to a lack of data also skips non-optional
    elements if the data pointer has reached the end of the buffer.
    
    This can be tested with the data decoder for the new RSA akcipher algorithm
    that takes three non-optional integers.  Currently, it skips the last
    integer if there is insufficient data.
    
    Without the fix, #defining DEBUG in asn1_decoder.c will show something
    like:
    
    	next_op: pc=0/13 dp=0/270 C=0 J=0
    	- match? 30 30 00
    	- TAG: 30 266 CONS
    	next_op: pc=2/13 dp=4/270 C=1 J=0
    	- match? 02 02 00
    	- TAG: 02 257
    	- LEAF: 257
    	next_op: pc=5/13 dp=265/270 C=1 J=0
    	- match? 02 02 00
    	- TAG: 02 3
    	- LEAF: 3
    	next_op: pc=8/13 dp=270/270 C=1 J=0
    	next_op: pc=11/13 dp=270/270 C=1 J=0
    	- end cons t=4 dp=270 l=270/270
    
    The next_op line for pc=8/13 should be followed by a match line.
    
    This is not exploitable for X.509 certificates by means of shortening the
    message and fixing up the ASN.1 CONS tags because:
    
     (1) The relevant records being built up are cleared before use.
    
     (2) If the message is shortened sufficiently to remove the public key, the
         ASN.1 parse of the RSA key will fail quickly due to a lack of data.
    
     (3) Extracted signature data is either turned into MPIs (which cope with a
         0 length) or is simpler integers specifying algoritms and suchlike
         (which can validly be 0); and
    
     (4) The AKID and SKID extensions are optional and their removal is handled
         without risking passing a NULL to asymmetric_key_generate_id().
    
     (5) If the certificate is truncated sufficiently to remove the subject,
         issuer or serialNumber then the ASN.1 decoder will fail with a 'Cons
         stack underflow' return.
    
    This is not exploitable for PKCS#7 messages by means of removal of elements
    from such a message from the tail end of a sequence:
    
     (1) Any shortened X.509 certs embedded in the PKCS#7 message are survivable
         as detailed above.
    
     (2) The message digest content isn't used if it shows a NULL pointer,
         similarly, the authattrs aren't used if that shows a NULL pointer.
    
     (3) A missing signature results in a NULL MPI - which the MPI routines deal
         with.
    
     (4) If data is NULL, it is expected that the message has detached content and
         that is handled appropriately.
    
     (5) If the serialNumber is excised, the unconditional action associated
         with it will pick up the containing SEQUENCE instead, so no NULL
         pointer will be seen here.
    
         If both the issuer and the serialNumber are excised, the ASN.1 decode
         will fail with an 'Unexpected tag' return.
    
         In either case, there's no way to get to asymmetric_key_generate_id()
         with a NULL pointer.
    
     (6) Other fields are decoded to simple integers.  Shortening the message
         to omit an algorithm ID field will cause checks on this to fail early
         in the verification process.
    
    
    This can also be tested by snipping objects off of the end of the ASN.1 stream
    such that mandatory tags are removed - or even from the end of internal
    SEQUENCEs.  If any mandatory tag is missing, the error EBADMSG *should* be
    produced.  Without this patch ERANGE or ENOPKG might be produced or the parse
    may apparently succeed, perhaps with ENOKEY or EKEYREJECTED being produced
    later, depending on what gets snipped.
    
    Just snipping off the final BIT_STRING or OCTET_STRING from either sample
    should be a start since both are mandatory and neither will cause an EBADMSG
    without the patches

    x86/mm: Add barriers and document switch_mm()-vs-flush synchronization
    
    When switch_mm() activates a new PGD, it also sets a bit that
    tells other CPUs that the PGD is in use so that TLB flush IPIs
    will be sent.  In order for that to work correctly, the bit
    needs to be visible prior to loading the PGD and therefore
    starting to fill the local TLB.
    
    Document all the barriers that make this work correctly and add
    a couple that were missing.

Author: Yuchung Cheng <ycheng@google.com>

    tcp: fix zero cwnd in tcp_cwnd_reduction
    
    Patch 3759824da87b ("tcp: PRR uses CRB mode by default and SS mode
    conditionally") introduced a bug that cwnd may become 0 when both
    inflight and sndcnt are 0 (cwnd = inflight + sndcnt). This may lead
    to a div-by-zero if the connection starts another cwnd reduction
    phase by setting tp->prior_cwnd to the current cwnd (0) in
    tcp_init_cwnd_reduction().
    
    To prevent this we skip PRR operation when nothing is acked or
    sacked. Then cwnd must be positive in all cases as long as ssthresh
    is positive:
    
    1) The proportional reduction mode
       inflight > ssthresh > 0
    
    2) The reduction bound mode
      a) inflight == ssthresh > 0
    
      b) inflight < ssthresh
         sndcnt > 0 since newly_acked_sacked > 0 and inflight < ssthresh
    
    Therefore in all cases inflight and sndcnt can not both be 0.
    We check invalid tp->prior_cwnd to avoid potential div0 bugs.
    
    In reality this bug is triggered only with a sequence of less common
    events.  For example, the connection is terminating an ECN-triggered
    cwnd reduction with an inflight 0, then it receives reordered/old
    ACKs or DSACKs from prior transmission (which acks nothing). Or the
    connection is in fast recovery stage that marks everything lost,
    but fails to retransmit due to local issues, then receives data
    packets from other end which acks nothing.

    EVM: Use crypto_memneq() for digest comparisons
    
    This patch fixes vulnerability CVE-2016-2085.  The problem exists
    because the vm_verify_hmac() function includes a use of memcmp().
    Unfortunately, this allows timing side channel attacks; specifically
    a MAC forgery complexity drop from 2^128 to 2^12.  This patch changes
    the memcmp() to the cryptographically safe crypto_memneq().

    atl2: Disable unimplemented scatter/gather feature
    
    atl2 includes NETIF_F_SG in hw_features even though it has no support
    for non-linear skbs.  This bug was originally harmless since the
    driver does not claim to implement checksum offload and that used to
    be a requirement for SG.
    
    Now that SG and checksum offload are independent features, if you
    explicitly enable SG *and* use one of the rare protocols that can use
    SG without checkusm offload, this potentially leaks sensitive
    information (before you notice that it just isn't working).  Therefore
    this obscure bug has been designated CVE-2016-2117.

    All new mm contexts are created with three page table levels and
    an asce limit of 4TB. If the parent has four levels dup_mmap will
    add vmas to the new context which are outside of the asce limit.
    The subsequent call to copy_page_range will walk the three level
    page table structure of the new process with non-zero pgd and pud
    indexes. This leads to memory clobbers as the pgd_index *and* the
    pud_index is added to the mm->pgd pointer without a pgd_deref
    in between.
    
    The init_new_context() function is selecting the number of page
    table levels for a new context. The function is used by mm_init()
    which in turn is called by dup_mm() and mm_alloc(). These two are
    used by fork() and exec(). The init_new_context() function can
    distinguish the two cases by looking at mm->context.asce_limit,
    for fork() the mm struct has been copied and the number of page
    table levels may not change. For exec() the mm_alloc() function
    set the new mm structure to zero, in this case a three-level page
    table is created as the temporary stack space is located at
    STACK_TOP_MAX = 4TB.
    
    This fixes CVE-2016-2143.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix NULL dereference in create_fixed_stream_quirk()
    
    create_fixed_stream_quirk() may cause a NULL-pointer dereference by
    accessing the non-existing endpoint when a USB device with a malformed
    USB descriptor is used.
    
    This patch avoids it simply by adding a sanity check of bNumEndpoints
    before the accesses.

commit a1b14d27ed0965838350f1377ff97c93ee383492
Author: Daniel Borkmann <daniel@iogearbox.net>
Date:   Wed Feb 10 16:47:11 2016 +0100

    bpf: fix branch offset adjustment on backjumps after patching ctx expansion
    
    When ctx access is used, the kernel often needs to expand/rewrite
    instructions, so after that patching, branch offsets have to be
    adjusted for both forward and backward jumps in the new eBPF program,
    but for backward jumps it fails to account the delta. Meaning, for
    example, if the expansion happens exactly on the insn that sits at
    the jump target, it doesn't fix up the back jump offset.
    
    Analysis on what the check in adjust_branches() is currently doing:
    
      /* adjust offset of jmps if necessary */
      if (i < pos && i + insn->off + 1 > pos)
        insn->off += delta;
      else if (i > pos && i + insn->off + 1 < pos)
        insn->off -= delta;
    
    First condition (forward jumps):
    
      Before:                         After:
    
      insns[0]                        insns[0]
      insns[1] <--- i/insn            insns[1] <--- i/insn
      insns[2] <--- pos               insns[P] <--- pos
      insns[3]                        insns[P]  `------| delta
      insns[4] <--- target_X          insns[P]   `-----|
      insns[5]                        insns[3]
                                      insns[4] <--- target_X
                                      insns[5]
    
    First case is if we cross pos-boundary and the jump instruction was
    before pos. This is handeled correctly. I.e. if i == pos, then this
    would mean our jump that we currently check was the patchlet itself
    that we just injected. Since such patchlets are self-contained and
    have no awareness of any insns before or after the patched one, the
    delta is correctly not adjusted. Also, for the second condition in
    case of i + insn->off + 1 == pos, means we jump to that newly patched
    instruction, so no offset adjustment are needed. That part is correct.
    
    Second condition (backward jumps):
    
      Before:                         After:
    
      insns[0]                        insns[0]
      insns[1] <--- target_X          insns[1] <--- target_X
      insns[2] <--- pos <-- target_Y  insns[P] <--- pos <-- target_Y
      insns[3]                        insns[P]  `------| delta
      insns[4] <--- i/insn            insns[P]   `-----|
      insns[5]                        insns[3]
                                      insns[4] <--- i/insn
                                      insns[5]
    
    Second interesting case is where we cross pos-boundary and the jump
    instruction was after pos. Backward jump with i == pos would be
    impossible and pose a bug somewhere in the patchlet, so the first
    condition checking i > pos is okay only by itself. However, i +
    insn->off + 1 < pos does not always work as intended to trigger the
    adjustment. It works when jump targets would be far off where the
    delta wouldn't matter. But, for example, where the fixed insn->off
    before pointed to pos (target_Y), it now points to pos + delta, so
    that additional room needs to be taken into account for the check.
    This means that i) both tests here need to be adjusted into pos + delta,
    and ii) for the second condition, the test needs to be <= as pos
    itself can be a target in the backjump, too.

    ALSA: seq: Fix race at timer setup and close
    
    ALSA sequencer code has an open race between the timer setup ioctl and
    the close of the client.  This was triggered by syzkaller fuzzer, and
    a use-after-free was caught there as a result.
    
    This patch papers over it by adding a proper queue->timer_mutex lock
    around the timer-related calls in the relevant code path.

    ALSA: timer: Fix double unlink of active_list
    
    ALSA timer instance object has a couple of linked lists and they are
    unlinked unconditionally at snd_timer_stop().  Meanwhile
    snd_timer_interrupt() unlinks it, but it calls list_del() which leaves
    the element list itself unchanged.  This ends up with unlinking twice,
    and it was caught by syzkaller fuzzer.
    
    The fix is to use list_del_init() variant properly there, too.

    ALSA: timer: Fix race among timer ioctls
    
    ALSA timer ioctls have an open race and this may lead to a
    use-after-free of timer instance object.  A simplistic fix is to make
    each ioctl exclusive.  We have already tread_sem for controlling the
    tread, and extend this as a global mutex to be applied to each ioctl.
    
    The downside is, of course, the worse concurrency.  But these ioctls
    aren't to be parallel accessible, in anyway, so it should be fine to
    serialize there.

    ALSA: timer: Harden slave timer list handling
    
    A slave timer instance might be still accessible in a racy way while
    operating the master instance as it lacks of locking.  Since the
    master operation is mostly protected with timer->lock, we should cope
    with it while changing the slave instance, too.  Also, some linked
    lists (active_list and ack_list) of slave instances aren't unlinked
    immediately at stopping or closing, and this may lead to unexpected
    accesses.
    
    This patch tries to address these issues.  It adds spin lock of
    timer->lock (either from master or slave, which is equivalent) in a
    few places.  For avoiding a deadlock, we ensure that the global
    slave_active_lock is always locked at first before each timer lock.
    
    Also, ack and active_list of slave instances are properly unlinked at
    snd_timer_stop() and snd_timer_close().
    
    Last but not least, remove the superfluous call of _snd_timer_stop()
    at removing slave links.  This is a noop, and calling it may confuse
    readers wrt locking.  Further cleanup will follow in a later patch.
    
    Actually we've got reports of use-after-free by syzkaller fuzzer, and
    this hopefully fixes these issues.

    ALSA: hrtimer: Fix stall by hrtimer_cancel()
    
    hrtimer_cancel() waits for the completion from the callback, thus it
    must not be called inside the callback itself.  This was already a
    problem in the past with ALSA hrtimer driver, and the early commit
    [fcfdebe70759: ALSA: hrtimer - Fix lock-up] tried to address it.
    
    However, the previous fix is still insufficient: it may still cause a
    lockup when the ALSA timer instance reprograms itself in its callback.
    Then it invokes the start function even in snd_timer_interrupt() that
    is called in hrtimer callback itself, results in a CPU stall.  This is
    no hypothetical problem but actually triggered by syzkaller fuzzer.
    
    This patch tries to fix the issue again.  Now we call
    hrtimer_try_to_cancel() at both start and stop functions so that it
    won't fall into a deadlock, yet giving some chance to cancel the queue
    if the functions have been called outside the callback.  The proper
    hrtimer_cancel() is called in anyway at closing, so this should be
    enough.

    unix: correctly track in-flight fds in sending process user_struct
    
    The commit referenced in the Fixes tag incorrectly accounted the number
    of in-flight fds over a unix domain socket to the original opener
    of the file-descriptor. This allows another process to arbitrary
    deplete the original file-openers resource limit for the maximum of
    open files. Instead the sending processes and its struct cred should
    be credited.
    
    To do so, we add a reference counted struct user_struct pointer to the
    scm_fp_list and use it to account for the number of inflight unix fds.

    pipe: limit the per-user amount of pages allocated in pipes
    
    On no-so-small systems, it is possible for a single process to cause an
    OOM condition by filling large pipes with data that are never read. A
    typical process filling 4000 pipes with 1 MB of data will use 4 GB of
    memory. On small systems it may be tricky to set the pipe max size to
    prevent this from happening.
    
    This patch makes it possible to enforce a per-user soft limit above
    which new pipes will be limited to a single page, effectively limiting
    them to 4 kB each, as well as a hard limit above which no new pipes may
    be created for this user. This has the effect of protecting the system
    against memory abuse without hurting other users, and still allowing
    pipes to work correctly though with less data at once.
    
    The limit are controlled by two new sysctls : pipe-user-pages-soft, and
    pipe-user-pages-hard. Both may be disabled by setting them to zero. The
    default soft limit allows the default number of FDs per process (1024)
    to create pipes of the default size (64kB), thus reaching a limit of 64MB
    before starting to create only smaller pipes. With 256 processes limited
    to 1024 FDs each, this results in 1024*64kB + (256*1024 - 1024) * 4kB =
    1084 MB of memory allocated for a user. The hard limit is disabled by
    default to avoid breaking existing applications that make intensive use
    of pipes (eg: for splicing).

commit 42cb14b110a5698ccf26ce59c4441722605a3743
Author: Hugh Dickins <hughd@google.com>
Date:   Thu Nov 5 18:50:05 2015 -0800

    mm: migrate dirty page without clear_page_dirty_for_io etc
    
    clear_page_dirty_for_io() has accumulated writeback and memcg subtleties
    since v2.6.16 first introduced page migration; and the set_page_dirty()
    which completed its migration of PageDirty, later had to be moderated to
    __set_page_dirty_nobuffers(); then PageSwapBacked had to skip that too.
    
    No actual problems seen with this procedure recently, but if you look into
    what the clear_page_dirty_for_io(page)+set_page_dirty(newpage) is actually
    achieving, it turns out to be nothing more than moving the PageDirty flag,
    and its NR_FILE_DIRTY stat from one zone to another.
    
    It would be good to avoid a pile of irrelevant decrementations and
    incrementations, and improper event counting, and unnecessary descent of
    the radix_tree under tree_lock (to set the PAGECACHE_TAG_DIRTY which
    radix_tree_replace_slot() left in place anyway).
    
    Do the NR_FILE_DIRTY movement, like the other stats movements, while
    interrupts still disabled in migrate_page_move_mapping(); and don't even
    bother if the zone is the same.  Do the PageDirty movement there under
    tree_lock too, where old page is frozen and newpage not yet visible:
    bearing in mind that as soon as newpage becomes visible in radix_tree, an
    un-page-locked set_page_dirty() might interfere (or perhaps that's just
    not possible: anything doing so should already hold an additional
    reference to the old page, preventing its migration; but play safe).
    
    But we do still need to transfer PageDirty in migrate_page_copy(), for
    those who don't go the mapping route through migrate_page_move_mapping().

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 54d83fc74aa9ec72794373cb47432c5f7fb1a309
Author: Florian Westphal <fw@strlen.de>
Date:   Tue Mar 22 18:02:52 2016 +0100

    netfilter: x_tables: fix unconditional helper
    
    Ben Hawkes says:
    
     In the mark_source_chains function (net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_tables.c) it
     is possible for a user-supplied ipt_entry structure to have a large
     next_offset field. This field is not bounds checked prior to writing a
     counter value at the supplied offset.
    
    Problem is that mark_source_chains should not have been called --
    the rule doesn't have a next entry, so its supposed to return
    an absolute verdict of either ACCEPT or DROP.
    
    However, the function conditional() doesn't work as the name implies.
    It only checks that the rule is using wildcard address matching.
    
    However, an unconditional rule must also not be using any matches
    (no -m args).
    
    The underflow validator only checked the addresses, therefore
    passing the 'unconditional absolute verdict' test, while
    mark_source_chains also tested for presence of matches, and thus
    proceeeded to the next (not-existent) rule.
    
    Unify this so that all the callers have same idea of 'unconditional rule'.

    ipv4: Don't do expensive useless work during inetdev destroy.
    
    When an inetdev is destroyed, every address assigned to the interface
    is removed.  And in this scenerio we do two pointless things which can
    be very expensive if the number of assigned interfaces is large:
    
    1) Address promotion.  We are deleting all addresses, so there is no
       point in doing this.
    
    2) A full nf conntrack table purge for every address.  We only need to
       do this once, as is already caught by the existing
       masq_dev_notifier so masq_inet_event() can skip this.

    x86/iopl/64: Properly context-switch IOPL on Xen PV
    
    On Xen PV, regs->flags doesn't reliably reflect IOPL and the
    exit-to-userspace code doesn't change IOPL.  We need to context
    switch it manually.
    
    I'm doing this without going through paravirt because this is
    specific to Xen PV.  After the dust settles, we can merge this with
    the 32-bit code, tidy up the iopl syscall implementation, and remove
    the set_iopl pvop entirely.
    
    Fixes XSA-171.

commit 8b8addf891de8a00e4d39fc32f93f7c5eb8feceb
Author: Hector Marco-Gisbert <hecmargi@upv.es>
Date:   Thu Mar 10 20:51:00 2016 +0100

    x86/mm/32: Enable full randomization on i386 and X86_32
    
    Currently on i386 and on X86_64 when emulating X86_32 in legacy mode, only
    the stack and the executable are randomized but not other mmapped files
    (libraries, vDSO, etc.). This patch enables randomization for the
    libraries, vDSO and mmap requests on i386 and in X86_32 in legacy mode.
    
    By default on i386 there are 8 bits for the randomization of the libraries,
    vDSO and mmaps which only uses 1MB of VA.
    
    This patch preserves the original randomness, using 1MB of VA out of 3GB or
    4GB. We think that 1MB out of 3GB is not a big cost for having the ASLR.
    
    The first obvious security benefit is that all objects are randomized (not
    only the stack and the executable) in legacy mode which highly increases
    the ASLR effectiveness, otherwise the attackers may use these
    non-randomized areas. But also sensitive setuid/setgid applications are
    more secure because currently, attackers can disable the randomization of
    these applications by setting the ulimit stack to "unlimited". This is a
    very old and widely known trick to disable the ASLR in i386 which has been
    allowed for too long.
    
    Another trick used to disable the ASLR was to set the ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE
    personality flag, but fortunately this doesn't work on setuid/setgid
    applications because there is security checks which clear Security-relevant
    flags.
    
    This patch always randomizes the mmap_legacy_base address, removing the
    possibility to disable the ASLR by setting the stack to "unlimited".

commit 9842df62004f366b9fed2423e24df10542ee0dc5
Author: Andy Honig <ahonig@google.com>
Date:   Tue May 17 17:41:47 2016 +0200

    KVM: MTRR: remove MSR 0x2f8
    
    MSR 0x2f8 accessed the 124th Variable Range MTRR ever since MTRR support
    was introduced by 9ba075a664df ("KVM: MTRR support").
    
    0x2f8 became harmful when 910a6aae4e2e ("KVM: MTRR: exactly define the
    size of variable MTRRs") shrinked the array of VR MTRRs from 256 to 8,
    which made access to index 124 out of bounds.  The surrounding code only
    WARNs in this situation, thus the guest gained a limited read/write
    access to struct kvm_arch_vcpu.
    
    0x2f8 is not a valid VR MTRR MSR, because KVM has/advertises only 16 VR
    MTRR MSRs, 0x200-0x20f.  Every VR MTRR is set up using two MSRs, 0x2f8
    was treated as a PHYSBASE and 0x2f9 would be its PHYSMASK, but 0x2f9 was
    not implemented in KVM, therefore 0x2f8 could never do anything useful
    and getting rid of it is safe.
    
    This fixes CVE-2016-3713.

    ipv6: add complete rcu protection around np->opt
    
    This patch addresses multiple problems :
    
    UDP/RAW sendmsg() need to get a stable struct ipv6_txoptions
    while socket is not locked : Other threads can change np->opt
    concurrently. Dmitry posted a syzkaller
    (http://github.com/google/syzkaller) program desmonstrating
    use-after-free.
    
    Starting with TCP/DCCP lockless listeners, tcp_v6_syn_recv_sock()
    and dccp_v6_request_recv_sock() also need to use RCU protection
    to dereference np->opt once (before calling ipv6_dup_options())
    
    This patch adds full RCU protection to np->opt

    usbnet_link_change will call schedule_work and should be

    USB: usbip: fix potential out-of-bounds write
    
    Fix potential out-of-bounds write to urb->transfer_buffer
    usbip handles network communication directly in the kernel. When receiving a
    packet from its peer, usbip code parses headers according to protocol. As
    part of this parsing urb->actual_length is filled. Since the input for
    urb->actual_length comes from the network, it should be treated as untrusted.
    Any entity controlling the network may put any value in the input and the
    preallocated urb->transfer_buffer may not be large enough to hold the data.
    Thus, the malicious entity is able to write arbitrary data to kernel memory.

    denies such PTEs to be created, but error indications can't be

commit 3ce424e45411cf5a13105e0386b6ecf6eeb4f66f

    kvm:vmx: more complete state update on APICv on/off
    
    The function to update APICv on/off state (in particular, to deactivate
    it when enabling Hyper-V SynIC) is incomplete: it doesn't adjust
    APICv-related fields among secondary processor-based VM-execution
    controls.  As a result, Windows 2012 guests get stuck when SynIC-based
    auto-EOI interrupt intersected with e.g. an IPI in the guest.
    
    In addition, the MSR intercept bitmap isn't updated every time "virtualize
    x2APIC mode" is toggled.  This path can only be triggered by a malicious
    guest, because Windows didn't use x2APIC but rather their own synthetic
    APIC access MSRs; however a guest running in a SynIC-enabled VM could
    switch to x2APIC and thus obtain direct access to host APIC MSRs
    (CVE-2016-4440).
    
    The patch fixes those omissions.

Author: Dan Carpenter <dan.carpenter@oracle.com>
Date:   Thu Jun 16 15:48:57 2016 +0100

    KEYS: potential uninitialized variable
    
    If __key_link_begin() failed then "edit" would be uninitialized.  I've
    added a check to fix that.
    
    This allows a random user to crash the kernel, though it's quite
    difficult to achieve.  There are three ways it can be done as the user
    would have to cause an error to occur in __key_link():
    
     (1) Cause the kernel to run out of memory.  In practice, this is difficult
         to achieve without ENOMEM cropping up elsewhere and aborting the
         attempt.
    
     (2) Revoke the destination keyring between the keyring ID being looked up
         and it being tested for revocation.  In practice, this is difficult to
         time correctly because the KEYCTL_REJECT function can only be used
         from the request-key upcall process.  Further, users can only make use
         of what's in /sbin/request-key.conf, though this does including a
         rejection debugging test - which means that the destination keyring
         has to be the caller's session keyring in practice.
    
     (3) Have just enough key quota available to create a key, a new session
         keyring for the upcall and a link in the session keyring, but not then
         sufficient quota to create a link in the nominated destination keyring
         so that it fails with EDQUOT.
    
    The bug can be triggered using option (3) above using something like the
    following:
    
    	echo 80 >/proc/sys/kernel/keys/root_maxbytes
    	keyctl request2 user debug:fred negate @t
    
    The above sets the quota to something much lower (80) to make the bug
    easier to trigger, but this is dependent on the system.  Note also that
    the name of the keyring created contains a random number that may be
    between 1 and 10 characters in size, so may throw the test off by
    changing the amount of quota used.
    
    Assuming the failure occurs, something like the following will be seen:
    
    	kfree_debugcheck: out of range ptr 6b6b6b6b6b6b6b68h

    bpf: fix double-fdput in replace_map_fd_with_map_ptr()
    
    When bpf(BPF_PROG_LOAD, ...) was invoked with a BPF program whose bytecode
    references a non-map file descriptor as a map file descriptor, the error
    handling code called fdput() twice instead of once (in __bpf_map_get() and
    in replace_map_fd_with_map_ptr()). If the file descriptor table of the
    current task is shared, this causes f_count to be decremented too much,
    allowing the struct file to be freed while it is still in use
    (use-after-free). This can be exploited to gain root privileges by an
    unprivileged user.
    
    This bug was introduced in
    commit 0246e64d9a5f ("bpf: handle pseudo BPF_LD_IMM64 insn"), but is only
    exploitable since
    commit 1be7f75d1668 ("bpf: enable non-root eBPF programs") because
    previously, CAP_SYS_ADMIN was required to reach the vulnerable code.

    bpf: fix refcnt overflow
    
    On a system with >32Gbyte of phyiscal memory and infinite RLIMIT_MEMLOCK,
    the malicious application may overflow 32-bit bpf program refcnt.
    It's also possible to overflow map refcnt on 1Tb system.
    Impose 32k hard limit which means that the same bpf program or
    map cannot be shared by more than 32k processes.

commit e6bd18f57aad1a2d1ef40e646d03ed0f2515c9e3
Author: Jason Gunthorpe <jgunthorpe@obsidianresearch.com>
Date:   Sun Apr 10 19:13:13 2016 -0600

    IB/security: Restrict use of the write() interface
    
    The drivers/infiniband stack uses write() as a replacement for
    bi-directional ioctl().  This is not safe. There are ways to
    trigger write calls that result in the return structure that
    is normally written to user space being shunted off to user
    specified kernel memory instead.
    
    For the immediate repair, detect and deny suspicious accesses to
    the write API.
    
    For long term, update the user space libraries and the kernel API
    to something that doesn't present the same security vulnerabilities
    (likely a structured ioctl() interface).
    
    The impacted uAPI interfaces are generally only available if
    hardware from drivers/infiniband is installed in the system.

    This oops happens with the namespace_sem held and can be triggered by
    non-root users.  An all around not pleasant experience.
    
    To avoid this scenario when finding the appropriate source mount to
    copy stop the walk up the mnt_master chain when the first source mount
    is encountered.
    
    Further rewrite the walk up the last_source mnt_master chain so that
    it is clear what is going on.
    
    The reason why the first source mount is special is that it it's
    mnt_parent is not a mount in the dest_mnt propagation tree, and as
    such termination conditions based up on the dest_mnt mount propgation
    tree do not make sense.
    
    To avoid other kinds of confusion last_dest is not changed when
    computing last_source.  last_dest is only used once in propagate_one
    and that is above the point of the code being modified, so changing
    the global variable is meaningless and confusing.

    percpu: fix synchronization between synchronous map extension and chunk destruction
    
    For non-atomic allocations, pcpu_alloc() can try to extend the area
    map synchronously after dropping pcpu_lock; however, the extension
    wasn't synchronized against chunk destruction and the chunk might get
    freed while extension is in progress.
    
    This patch fixes the bug by putting most of non-atomic allocations
    under pcpu_alloc_mutex to synchronize against pcpu_balance_work which
    is responsible for async chunk management including destruction.

Author: Tejun Heo <tj@kernel.org>

    percpu: fix synchronization between chunk->map_extend_work and chunk destruction
    
    Atomic allocations can trigger async map extensions which is serviced
    by chunk->map_extend_work.  pcpu_balance_work which is responsible for
    destroying idle chunks wasn't synchronizing properly against
    chunk->map_extend_work and may end up freeing the chunk while the work
    item is still in flight.
    
    This patch fixes the bug by rolling async map extension operations
    into pcpu_balance_work.

    ppp: take reference on channels netns
    
    Let channels hold a reference on their network namespace.
    Some channel types, like ppp_async and ppp_synctty, can have their
    userspace controller running in a different namespace. Therefore they
    can't rely on them to preclude their netns from being removed from
    under them.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 99d825822eade8d827a1817357cbf3f889a552d6
Author: Al Viro <viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk>
Date:   Thu May 5 16:25:35 2016 -0400

    get_rock_ridge_filename(): handle malformed NM entries
    
    Payloads of NM entries are not supposed to contain NUL.  When we run
    into such, only the part prior to the first NUL goes into the
    concatenation (i.e. the directory entry name being encoded by a bunch
    of NM entries).  We do stop when the amount collected so far + the
    claimed amount in the current NM entry exceed 254.  So far, so good,
    but what we return as the total length is the sum of *claimed*
    sizes, not the actual amount collected.  And that can grow pretty
    large - not unlimited, since you'd need to put CE entries in
    between to be able to get more than the maximum that could be
    contained in one isofs directory entry / continuation chunk and
    we are stop once we'd encountered 32 CEs, but you can get about 8Kb
    easily.  And that's what will be passed to readdir callback as the
    name length.  8Kb __copy_to_user() from a buffer allocated by
    __get_free_page()

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 19be0eaffa3ac7d8eb6784ad9bdbc7d67ed8e619
Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>
Date:   Thu Oct 13 13:07:36 2016 -0700

    mm: remove gup_flags FOLL_WRITE games from __get_user_pages()
    
    This is an ancient bug that was actually attempted to be fixed once
    (badly) by me eleven years ago in commit 4ceb5db9757a ("Fix
    get_user_pages() race for write access") but that was then undone due to
    problems on s390 by commit f33ea7f404e5 ("fix get_user_pages bug").
    
    In the meantime, the s390 situation has long been fixed, and we can now
    fix it by checking the pte_dirty() bit properly (and do it better).  The
    s390 dirty bit was implemented in abf09bed3cce ("s390/mm: implement
    software dirty bits") which made it into v3.9.  Earlier kernels will
    have to look at the page state itself.
    
    Also, the VM has become more scalable, and what used a purely
    theoretical race back then has become easier to trigger.
    
    To fix it, we introduce a new internal FOLL_COW flag to mark the "yes,
    we already did a COW" rather than play racy games with FOLL_WRITE that
    is very fundamental, and then use the pte dirty flag to validate that
    the FOLL_COW flag is still valid.

    media: fix airspy usb probe error path
    
    Fix a memory leak on probe error of the airspy usb device driver.
    
    The problem is triggered when more than 64 usb devices register with
    v4l2 of type VFL_TYPE_SDR or VFL_TYPE_SUBDEV.
    
    The memory leak is caused by the probe function of the airspy driver
    mishandeling errors and not freeing the corresponding control structures
    when an error occours registering the device to v4l2 core.
    
    A badusb device can emulate 64 of these devices, and then through
    continual emulated connect/disconnect of the 65th device, cause the
    kernel to run out of RAM and crash the kernel, thus causing a local DOS
    vulnerability.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 93d17397e4e2182fdaad503e2f9da46202c0f1c3
Author: Paul Mackerras <paulus@ozlabs.org>
Date:   Wed Jun 22 15:52:55 2016 +1000

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Save/restore TM state in H_CEDE
    
    It turns out that if the guest does a H_CEDE while the CPU is in
    a transactional state, and the H_CEDE does a nap, and the nap
    loses the architected state of the CPU (which is is allowed to do),
    then we lose the checkpointed state of the virtual CPU.  In addition,
    the transactional-memory state recorded in the MSR gets reset back
    to non-transactional, and when we try to return to the guest, we take
    a TM bad thing type of program interrupt because we are trying to
    transition from non-transactional to transactional with a hrfid
    instruction, which is not permitted.
    
    The result of the program interrupt occurring at that point is that
    the host CPU will hang in an infinite loop with interrupts disabled.
    Thus this is a denial of service vulnerability in the host which can
    be triggered by any guest (and depending on the guest kernel, it can
    potentially triggered by unprivileged userspace in the guest).
    
    This vulnerability has been assigned the ID CVE-2016-5412.
    
    To fix this, we save the TM state before napping and restore it
    on exit from the nap, when handling a H_CEDE in real mode.  The
    case where H_CEDE exits to host virtual mode is already OK (as are
    other hcalls which exit to host virtual mode) because the exit
    path saves the TM state.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Pull out TM state save/restore into separate procedures
    
    This moves the transactional memory state save and restore sequences
    out of the guest entry/exit paths into separate procedures.  This is
    so that these sequences can be used in going into and out of nap
    in a subsequent patch.
    
    The only code changes here are (a) saving and restore LR on the
    stack, since these new procedures get called with a bl instruction,
    (b) explicitly saving r1 into the PACA instead of assuming that
    HSTATE_HOST_R1(r13) is already set, and (c) removing an unnecessary
    and redundant setting of MSR[TM] that should have been removed by
    commit 9d4d0bdd9e0a ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Add transactional memory
    support", 2013-09-24) but wasn't.

    tcp: make challenge acks less predictable
    
    Yue Cao claims that current host rate limiting of challenge ACKS
    (RFC 5961) could leak enough information to allow a patient attacker
    to hijack TCP sessions. He will soon provide details in an academic
    paper.
    
    This patch increases the default limit from 100 to 1000, and adds
    some randomization so that the attacker can no longer hijack
    sessions without spending a considerable amount of probes.
    
    Based on initial analysis and patch from Linus.
    
    Note that we also have per socket rate limiting, so it is tempting
    to remove the host limit in the future.
    
    v2: randomize the count of challenge acks per second, not the period.

    misc: mic: Fix for double fetch security bug in VOP driver
    
    The MIC VOP driver does two successive reads from user space to read a
    variable length data structure. Kernel memory corruption can result if
    the data structure changes between the two reads. This patch disallows
    the chance of this happening.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 8e96a87c5431c256feb65bcfc5aec92d9f7839b6
Author: Cyril Bur <cyrilbur@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Jun 17 14:58:34 2016 +1000

    powerpc/tm: Always reclaim in start_thread() for exec() class syscalls
    
    Userspace can quite legitimately perform an exec() syscall with a
    suspended transaction. exec() does not return to the old process, rather
    it load a new one and starts that, the expectation therefore is that the
    new process starts not in a transaction. Currently exec() is not treated
    any differently to any other syscall which creates problems.
    
    Firstly it could allow a new process to start with a suspended
    transaction for a binary that no longer exists. This means that the
    checkpointed state won't be valid and if the suspended transaction were
    ever to be resumed and subsequently aborted (a possibility which is
    exceedingly likely as exec()ing will likely doom the transaction) the
    new process will jump to invalid state.
    
    Secondly the incorrect attempt to keep the transactional state while
    still zeroing state for the new process creates at least two TM Bad
    Things. The first triggers on the rfid to return to userspace as
    start_thread() has given the new process a 'clean' MSR but the suspend
    will still be set in the hardware MSR. The second TM Bad Thing triggers
    in __switch_to() as the processor is still transactionally suspended but
    __switch_to() wants to zero the TM sprs for the new process.
    
    This is an example of the outcome of calling exec() with a suspended
    transaction. Note the first 700 is likely the first TM bad thing
    decsribed earlier only the kernel can't report it as we've loaded
    userspace registers. c000000000009980 is the rfid in
    fast_exception_return()

    s390/sclp_ctl: fix potential information leak with /dev/sclp
    
    The sclp_ctl_ioctl_sccb function uses two copy_from_user calls to
    retrieve the sclp request from user space. The first copy_from_user
    fetches the length of the request which is stored in the first two
    bytes of the request. The second copy_from_user gets the complete
    sclp request, but this copies the length field a second time.
    A malicious user may have changed the length in the meantime.

commit 43761473c254b45883a64441dd0bc85a42f3645c
Author: Paul Moore <paul@paul-moore.com>

    audit: fix a double fetch in audit_log_single_execve_arg()
    
    There is a double fetch problem in audit_log_single_execve_arg()
    where we first check the execve(2) argumnets for any "bad" characters
    which would require hex encoding and then re-fetch the arguments for
    logging in the audit record[1].  Of course this leaves a window of
    opportunity for an unsavory application to munge with the data.
    
    This patch reworks things by only fetching the argument data once[2]
    into a buffer where it is scanned and logged into the audit
    records(s).  In addition to fixing the double fetch, this patch
    improves on the original code in a few other ways: better handling
    of large arguments which require encoding, stricter record length
    checking, and some performance improvements (completely unverified,
    but we got rid of some strlen() calls, that's got to be a good
    thing).
    
    As part of the development of this patch, I've also created a basic
    regression test for the audit-testsuite, the test can be tracked on
    GitHub at the following link:
    
     * https://github.com/linux-audit/audit-testsuite/issues/25
    
    [1] If you pay careful attention, there is actually a triple fetch
    problem due to a strnlen_user() call at the top of the function.
    
    [2] This is a tiny white lie, we do make a call to strnlen_user()
    prior to fetching the argument data.  I don't like it, but due to the
    way the audit record is structured we really have no choice unless we
    copy the entire argument at once (which would require a rather
    wasteful allocation).  The good news is that with this patch the
    kernel no longer relies on this strnlen_user() value for anything
    beyond recording it in the log, we also update it with a trustworthy
    value whenever possible.

    platform/chrome: cros_ec_dev - double fetch bug in ioctl
    
    We verify "u_cmd.outsize" and "u_cmd.insize" but we need to make sure
    that those values have not changed between the two copy_from_user()
    calls.  Otherwise it could lead to a buffer overflow.
    
    Additionally, cros_ec_cmd_xfer() can set s_cmd->insize to a lower value.
    We should use the new smaller value so we don't copy too much data to
    the user.

    apparmor: fix oops, validate buffer size in apparmor_setprocattr()
    
    When proc_pid_attr_write() was changed to use memdup_user apparmor's
    (interface violating) assumption that the setprocattr buffer was always
    a single page was violated.
    
    The size test is not strictly speaking needed as proc_pid_attr_write()
    will reject anything larger, but for the sake of robustness we can keep
    it in.
    
    SMACK and SELinux look safe to me, but somebody else should probably
    have a look just in case.
    
    Based on original patch from Vegard Nossum <vegard.nossum@oracle.com>
    modified for the case that apparmor provides null termination.

    ovl: verify upper dentry before unlink and rename
    
    Unlink and rename in overlayfs checked the upper dentry for staleness by
    verifying upper->d_parent against upperdir.  However the dentry can go
    stale also by being unhashed, for example.
    
    Expand the verification to actually look up the name again (under parent
    lock) and check if it matches the upper dentry.  This matches what the VFS
    does before passing the dentry to filesytem's unlink/rename methods, which
    excludes any inconsistency caused by overlayfs.

    vfs: rename: check backing inode being equal
    
    If a file is renamed to a hardlink of itself POSIX specifies that rename(2)
    should do nothing and return success.
    
    This condition is checked in vfs_rename().  However it won't detect hard
    links on overlayfs where these are given separate inodes on the overlayfs
    layer.
    
    Overlayfs itself detects this condition and returns success without doing
    anything, but then vfs_rename() will proceed as if this was a successful
    rename (detach_mounts(), d_move()).
    
    The correct thing to do is to detect this condition before even calling
    into overlayfs.  This patch does this by calling vfs_select_inode() to get
    the underlying inodes.

    tcp: fix use after free in tcp_xmit_retransmit_queue()
    
    When tcp_sendmsg() allocates a fresh and empty skb, it puts it at the
    tail of the write queue using tcp_add_write_queue_tail()
    
    Then it attempts to copy user data into this fresh skb.
    
    If the copy fails, we undo the work and remove the fresh skb.
    
    Unfortunately, this undo lacks the change done to tp->highest_sack and
    we can leave a dangling pointer (to a freed skb)
    
    Later, tcp_xmit_retransmit_queue() can dereference this pointer and
    access freed memory. For regular kernels where memory is not unmapped,
    this might cause SACK bugs because tcp_highest_sack_seq() is buggy,
    returning garbage instead of tp->snd_nxt, but with various debug
    features like CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC, this can crash the kernel.
    
    This bug was found by Marco Grassi thanks to syzkaller.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 073931017b49d9458aa351605b43a7e34598caef
Author: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>
Date:   Mon Sep 19 17:39:09 2016 +0200

    posix_acl: Clear SGID bit when setting file permissions
    
    When file permissions are modified via chmod(2) and the user is not in
    the owning group or capable of CAP_FSETID, the setgid bit is cleared in
    inode_change_ok().  Setting a POSIX ACL via setxattr(2) sets the file
    permissions as well as the new ACL, but doesn't clear the setgid bit in
    a similar way; this allows to bypass the check in chmod(2).  Fix that.

    net: Fix use after free in the recvmmsg exit path
    
    The syzkaller fuzzer hit the following use-after-free:
    
      Call Trace:
       [<ffffffff8175ea0e>] __asan_report_load8_noabort+0x3e/0x40 mm/kasan/report.c:295
       [<ffffffff851cc31a>] __sys_recvmmsg+0x6fa/0x7f0 net/socket.c:2261
       [<     inline     >] SYSC_recvmmsg net/socket.c:2281
       [<ffffffff851cc57f>] SyS_recvmmsg+0x16f/0x180 net/socket.c:2270
       [<ffffffff86332bb6>] entry_SYSCALL_64_fastpath+0x16/0x7a
      arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:185
    
    And, as Dmitry rightly assessed, that is because we can drop the
    reference and then touch it when the underlying recvmsg calls return
    some packets and then hit an error, which will make recvmmsg to set
    sock->sk->sk_err, oops, fix it.

    brcmfmac: avoid potential stack overflow in brcmf_cfg80211_start_ap()
    
    User-space can choose to omit NL80211_ATTR_SSID and only provide raw
    IE TLV data. When doing so it can provide SSID IE with length exceeding
    the allowed size. The driver further processes this IE copying it
    into a local variable without checking the length. Hence stack can be
    corrupted and used as exploit.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit fac8e0f579695a3ecbc4d3cac369139d7f819971
Author: Jesse Gross <jesse@kernel.org>
Date:   Sat Mar 19 09:32:01 2016 -0700

    tunnels: Don't apply GRO to multiple layers of encapsulation.
    
    When drivers express support for TSO of encapsulated packets, they
    only mean that they can do it for one layer of encapsulation.
    Supporting additional levels would mean updating, at a minimum,
    more IP length fields and they are unaware of this.
    
    No encapsulation device expresses support for handling offloaded
    encapsulated packets, so we won't generate these types of frames
    in the transmit path. However, GRO doesn't have a check for
    multiple levels of encapsulation and will attempt to build them.
    
    UDP tunnel GRO actually does prevent this situation but it only
    handles multiple UDP tunnels stacked on top of each other. This
    generalizes that solution to prevent any kind of tunnel stacking
    that would cause problems.
