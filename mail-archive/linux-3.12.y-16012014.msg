    KVM: x86: fix guest-initiated crash with x2apic (CVE-2013-6376)
    
    A guest can cause a BUG_ON() leading to a host kernel crash.
    When the guest writes to the ICR to request an IPI, while in x2apic
    mode the following things happen, the destination is read from
    ICR2, which is a register that the guest can control.
    
    kvm_irq_delivery_to_apic_fast uses the high 16 bits of ICR2 as the
    cluster id.  A BUG_ON is triggered, which is a protection against
    accessing map->logical_map with an out-of-bounds access and manages
    to avoid that anything really unsafe occurs.
    
    The logic in the code is correct from real HW point of view. The problem
    is that KVM supports only one cluster with ID 0 in clustered mode, but
    the code that has the bug does not take this into account.
