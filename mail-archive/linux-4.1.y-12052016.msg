Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit 408fb0e5aa7fda0059db282ff58c3b2a4278baa0
Author: Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk <konrad.wilk@oracle.com>

    xen/pciback: Don't allow MSI-X ops if PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY is not set.
    
    commit f598282f51 ("PCI: Fix the NIU MSI-X problem in a better way")
    teaches us that dealing with MSI-X can be troublesome.
    
    Further checks in the MSI-X architecture shows that if the
    PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY bit is turned of in the PCI_COMMAND we
    may not be able to access the BAR (since they are memory regions).
    
    Since the MSI-X tables are located in there.. that can lead
    to us causing PCIe errors. Inhibit us performing any
    operation on the MSI-X unless the MEMORY bit is set.
    
    Note that Xen hypervisor with:
    "x86/MSI-X: access MSI-X table only after having enabled MSI-X"
    will return:
    xen_pciback: 0000:0a:00.1: error -6 enabling MSI-X for guest 3!
    
    When the generic MSI code tries to setup the PIRQ without
    MEMORY bit set. Which means with later versions of Xen
    (4.6) this patch is not neccessary.
    
    This is part of XSA-157

    xen/pciback: Return error on XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msi when device has MSI or MSI-X enabled
    
    The guest sequence of:
    
     a) XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msi
     b) XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msi
     c) XEN_PCI_OP_disable_msi
    
    results in hitting an BUG_ON condition in the msi.c code.
    
    The MSI code uses an dev->msi_list to which it adds MSI entries.
    Under the above conditions an BUG_ON() can be hit. The device
    passed in the guest MUST have MSI capability.
    
    The a) adds the entry to the dev->msi_list and sets msi_enabled.
    The b) adds a second entry but adding in to SysFS fails (duplicate entry)
    and deletes all of the entries from msi_list and returns (with msi_enabled
    is still set).  c) pci_disable_msi passes the msi_enabled checks and hits:
    
    BUG_ON(list_empty(dev_to_msi_list(&dev->dev)));
    
    and blows up.
    
    The patch adds a simple check in the XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msi to guard
    against that. The check for msix_enabled is not stricly neccessary.
    
    This is part of XSA-157.

    xen/pciback: Return error on XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msix when device has MSI or MSI-X enabled
    
    The guest sequence of:
    
      a) XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msix
      b) XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msix
    
    results in hitting an NULL pointer due to using freed pointers.
    
    The device passed in the guest MUST have MSI-X capability.
    
    The a) constructs and SysFS representation of MSI and MSI groups.
    The b) adds a second set of them but adding in to SysFS fails (duplicate entry).
    'populate_msi_sysfs' frees the newly allocated msi_irq_groups (note that
    in a) pdev->msi_irq_groups is still set) and also free's ALL of the
    MSI-X entries of the device (the ones allocated in step a) and b)).
    
    The unwind code: 'free_msi_irqs' deletes all the entries and tries to
    delete the pdev->msi_irq_groups (which hasn't been set to NULL).
    However the pointers in the SysFS are already freed and we hit an
    NULL pointer further on when 'strlen' is attempted on a freed pointer.
    
    The patch adds a simple check in the XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msix to guard
    against that. The check for msi_enabled is not stricly neccessary.

    xen/pciback: For XEN_PCI_OP_disable_msi[|x] only disable if device has MSI(X) enabled.
    
    Otherwise just continue on, returning the same values as
    previously (return of 0, and op->result has the PIRQ value).
    
    This does not change the behavior of XEN_PCI_OP_disable_msi[|x].
    
    The pci_disable_msi or pci_disable_msix have the checks for
    msi_enabled or msix_enabled so they will error out immediately.
    
    However the guest can still call these operations and cause
    us to disable the 'ack_intr'. That means the backend IRQ handler
    for the legacy interrupt will not respond to interrupts anymore.
    
    This will lead to (if the device is causing an interrupt storm)
    for the Linux generic code to disable the interrupt line.
    
    Naturally this will only happen if the device in question
    is plugged in on the motherboard on shared level interrupt GSI.

commit a396f3a210c3a61e94d6b87ec05a75d0be2a60d0
Author: Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk <konrad.wilk@oracle.com>
Date:   Mon Nov 2 17:24:08 2015 -0500

    xen/pciback: Do not install an IRQ handler for MSI interrupts.
    
    Otherwise an guest can subvert the generic MSI code to trigger
    an BUG_ON condition during MSI interrupt freeing:
    
     for (i = 0; i < entry->nvec_used; i++)
            BUG_ON(irq_has_action(entry->irq + i));
    
    Xen PCI backed installs an IRQ handler (request_irq) for
    the dev->irq whenever the guest writes PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY
    (or PCI_COMMAND_IO) to the PCI_COMMAND register. This is
    done in case the device has legacy interrupts the GSI line
    is shared by the backend devices.
    
    To subvert the backend the guest needs to make the backend
    to change the dev->irq from the GSI to the MSI interrupt line,
    make the backend allocate an interrupt handler, and then command
    the backend to free the MSI interrupt and hit the BUG_ON.
    
    Since the backend only calls 'request_irq' when the guest
    writes to the PCI_COMMAND register the guest needs to call
    XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msi before any other operation. This will
    cause the generic MSI code to setup an MSI entry and
    populate dev->irq with the new PIRQ value.
    
    Then the guest can write to PCI_COMMAND PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY
    and cause the backend to setup an IRQ handler for dev->irq
    (which instead of the GSI value has the MSI pirq). See
    'xen_pcibk_control_isr'.
    
    Then the guest disables the MSI: XEN_PCI_OP_disable_msi
    which ends up triggering the BUG_ON condition in 'free_msi_irqs'
    as there is an IRQ handler for the entry->irq (dev->irq).
    
    Note that this cannot be done using MSI-X as the generic
    code does not over-write dev->irq with the MSI-X PIRQ values.
    
    The patch inhibits setting up the IRQ handler if MSI or
    MSI-X (for symmetry reasons) code had been called successfully.
    
    P.S.
    Xen PCIBack when it sets up the device for the guest consumption
    ends up writting 0 to the PCI_COMMAND (see xen_pcibk_reset_device).
    XSA-120 addendum patch removed that - however when upstreaming said
    addendum we found that it caused issues with qemu upstream. That
    has now been fixed in qemu upstream.

    xen/pciback: Don't allow MSI-X ops if PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY is not set.
    
    commit f598282f51 ("PCI: Fix the NIU MSI-X problem in a better way")
    teaches us that dealing with MSI-X can be troublesome.
    
    Further checks in the MSI-X architecture shows that if the
    PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY bit is turned of in the PCI_COMMAND we
    may not be able to access the BAR (since they are memory regions).
    
    Since the MSI-X tables are located in there.. that can lead

    Note that Xen hypervisor with:
    "x86/MSI-X: access MSI-X table only after having enabled MSI-X"
    will return:
    xen_pciback: 0000:0a:00.1: error -6 enabling MSI-X for guest 3!
    
    When the generic MSI code tries to setup the PIRQ without

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit a396f3a210c3a61e94d6b87ec05a75d0be2a60d0
Author: Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk <konrad.wilk@oracle.com>
Date:   Mon Nov 2 17:24:08 2015 -0500

    xen/pciback: Do not install an IRQ handler for MSI interrupts.
    
    Otherwise an guest can subvert the generic MSI code to trigger
    an BUG_ON condition during MSI interrupt freeing:
    
     for (i = 0; i < entry->nvec_used; i++)
            BUG_ON(irq_has_action(entry->irq + i));
    
    Xen PCI backed installs an IRQ handler (request_irq) for
    the dev->irq whenever the guest writes PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY
    (or PCI_COMMAND_IO) to the PCI_COMMAND register. This is
    done in case the device has legacy interrupts the GSI line
    is shared by the backend devices.
    
    To subvert the backend the guest needs to make the backend
    to change the dev->irq from the GSI to the MSI interrupt line,
    make the backend allocate an interrupt handler, and then command
    the backend to free the MSI interrupt and hit the BUG_ON.
    
    Since the backend only calls 'request_irq' when the guest
    writes to the PCI_COMMAND register the guest needs to call
    XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msi before any other operation. This will
    cause the generic MSI code to setup an MSI entry and
    populate dev->irq with the new PIRQ value.
    
    Then the guest can write to PCI_COMMAND PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY
    and cause the backend to setup an IRQ handler for dev->irq
    (which instead of the GSI value has the MSI pirq). See
    'xen_pcibk_control_isr'.
    
    Then the guest disables the MSI: XEN_PCI_OP_disable_msi
    which ends up triggering the BUG_ON condition in 'free_msi_irqs'
    as there is an IRQ handler for the entry->irq (dev->irq).
    
    Note that this cannot be done using MSI-X as the generic
    code does not over-write dev->irq with the MSI-X PIRQ values.
    
    The patch inhibits setting up the IRQ handler if MSI or
    MSI-X (for symmetry reasons) code had been called successfully.
    
    P.S.
    Xen PCIBack when it sets up the device for the guest consumption
    ends up writting 0 to the PCI_COMMAND (see xen_pcibk_reset_device).
    XSA-120 addendum patch removed that - however when upstreaming said
    addendum we found that it caused issues with qemu upstream. That
    has now been fixed in qemu upstream.
    
    This is part of XSA-157

    Input: gtco - fix crash on detecting device without endpoints
    
    The gtco driver expects at least one valid endpoint. If given malicious
    descriptors that specify 0 for the number of endpoints, it will crash in
    the probe function. Ensure there is at least one endpoint on the interface
    before using it.
    
    Also let's fix a minor coding style issue.
    
    The full correct report of this issue can be found in the public
    Red Hat Bugzilla:

    x86/mm/xen: Suppress hugetlbfs in PV guests
    
    Huge pages are not normally available to PV guests. Not suppressing
    hugetlbfs use results in an endless loop of page faults when user mode
    code tries to access a hugetlbfs mapped area (since the hypervisor
    denies such PTEs to be created, but error indications can't be
    propagated out of xen_set_pte_at(), just like for various of its
    siblings), and - once killed in an oops like this:
    
      kernel BUG at .../fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c:428!
