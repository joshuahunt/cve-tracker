    ping: implement proper locking
    
    We got a report of yet another bug in ping
    
    http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/03/24/6
    
    ->disconnect() is not called with socket lock held.
    
    Fix this by acquiring ping rwlock earlier.
    
    Thanks to Daniel, Alexander and Andrey for letting us know this problem.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit dfcb9f4f99f1e9a49e43398a7bfbf56927544af1

    sctp: deny peeloff operation on asocs with threads sleeping on it
    
    commit 2dcab5984841 ("sctp: avoid BUG_ON on sctp_wait_for_sndbuf")
    attempted to avoid a BUG_ON call when the association being used for a
    sendmsg() is blocked waiting for more sndbuf and another thread did a
    peeloff operation on such asoc, moving it to another socket.
    
    As Ben Hutchings noticed, then in such case it would return without
    locking back the socket and would cause two unlocks in a row.
    
    Further analysis also revealed that it could allow a double free if the
    application managed to peeloff the asoc that is created during the
    sendmsg call, because then sctp_sendmsg() would try to free the asoc
    that was created only for that call.
    
    This patch takes another approach. It will deny the peeloff operation
    if there is a thread sleeping on the asoc, so this situation doesn't
    exist anymore. This avoids the issues described above and also honors
    the syscalls that are already being handled (it can be multiple sendmsg
    calls).
    
    Joint work with Xin Long.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit a4866aa812518ed1a37d8ea0c881dc946409de94
Author: Kees Cook <keescook@chromium.org>
Date:   Wed Apr 5 09:39:08 2017 -0700

    mm: Tighten x86 /dev/mem with zeroing reads
    
    Under CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM, reading System RAM through /dev/mem is
    disallowed. However, on x86, the first 1MB was always allowed for BIOS
    and similar things, regardless of it actually being System RAM. It was
    possible for heap to end up getting allocated in low 1MB RAM, and then
    read by things like x86info or dd, which would trip hardened usercopy:
    
    usercopy: kernel memory exposure attempt detected from ffff880000090000 (dma-kmalloc-256) (4096 bytes)
    
    This changes the x86 exception for the low 1MB by reading back zeros for
    System RAM areas instead of blindly allowing them. More work is needed to
    extend this to mmap, but currently mmap doesn't go through usercopy, so
    hardened usercopy won't Oops the kernel.
