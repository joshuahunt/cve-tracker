    KVM: ioapic: fix assignment of ioapic->rtc_status.pending_eoi (CVE-2014-0155)
    
    QE reported that they got the BUG_ON in ioapic_service to trigger.
    I cannot reproduce it, but there are two reasons why this could happen.
    
    The less likely but also easiest one, is when kvm_irq_delivery_to_apic
    does not deliver to any APIC and returns -1.
    
    Because irqe.shorthand == 0, the kvm_for_each_vcpu loop in that
    function is never reached.  However, you can target the similar loop in
    kvm_irq_delivery_to_apic_fast; just program a zero logical destination
    address into the IOAPIC, or an out-of-range physical destination address.

Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit b04c46190219a4f845e46a459e3102137b7f6cac
Author: Wang, Xiaoming <xiaoming.wang@intel.com>
Date:   Mon Apr 14 12:30:45 2014 -0400

    net: ipv4: current group_info should be put after using.
    
    Plug a group_info refcount leak in ping_init.
    group_info is only needed during initialization and
    the code failed to release the reference on exit.
    While here move grabbing the reference to a place
    where it is actually needed.
