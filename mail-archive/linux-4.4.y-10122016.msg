    netlink: Fix dump skb leak/double free
    
    When we free cb->skb after a dump, we do it after releasing the
    lock.  This means that a new dump could have started in the time
    being and we'll end up freeing their skb instead of ours.
    
    This patch saves the skb and module before we unlock so we free
    the right memory.
