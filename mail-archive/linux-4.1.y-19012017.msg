Description of fix for this vulnerability:
commit fac8e0f579695a3ecbc4d3cac369139d7f819971

    tunnels: Don't apply GRO to multiple layers of encapsulation.
    
    When drivers express support for TSO of encapsulated packets, they
    only mean that they can do it for one layer of encapsulation.
    Supporting additional levels would mean updating, at a minimum,
    more IP length fields and they are unaware of this.
    
    No encapsulation device expresses support for handling offloaded
    encapsulated packets, so we won't generate these types of frames
    in the transmit path. However, GRO doesn't have a check for
    multiple levels of encapsulation and will attempt to build them.
    
    UDP tunnel GRO actually does prevent this situation but it only
    handles multiple UDP tunnels stacked on top of each other. This
    generalizes that solution to prevent any kind of tunnel stacking
    that would cause problems.

    kvm: nVMX: Allow L1 to intercept software exceptions (#BP and #OF)
    
    When L2 exits to L0 due to "exception or NMI", software exceptions
    (#BP and #OF) for which L1 has requested an intercept should be
    handled by L1 rather than L0. Previously, only hardware exceptions
    were forwarded to L1.
