    drm/vmwgfx: NULL pointer dereference in vmw_surface_define_ioctl()
    
    Before memory allocations vmw_surface_define_ioctl() checks the
    upper-bounds of a user-supplied size, but does not check if the
    supplied size is 0.
    
    Add check to avoid NULL pointer dereferences.

    drm/vmwgfx: fix integer overflow in vmw_surface_define_ioctl()
    
    In vmw_surface_define_ioctl(), the 'num_sizes' is the sum of the
    'req->mip_levels' array. This array can be assigned any value from
    the user space. As both the 'num_sizes' and the array is uint32_t,
    it is easy to make 'num_sizes' overflow. The later 'mip_levels' is
    used as the loop count. This can lead an oob write. Add the check of
    'req->mip_levels' to avoid this.
